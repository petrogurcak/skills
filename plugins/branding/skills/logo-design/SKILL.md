# Logo Design

Reference guide for creating effective, memorable logos. Covers principles, psychology, professional process, and evaluation.

## When to Use

- Briefing a designer or agency on logo creation
- DIY logo design (AI-assisted or manual)
- Evaluating/reviewing existing logos
- Rebranding or logo refresh decisions
- Building brand identity from scratch

## Paul Rand's 7-Step Logo Test

Evaluate any logo against these 7 criteria:

| # | Criterion | Question |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **Distinctive** | Does it embody unique features and values? |
| 2 | **Visible** | Is it noticeable through color, size, or concept? |
| 3 | **Adaptable** | Does it work on a t-shirt AND a billboard? |
| 4 | **Memorable** | Can people recall it after one viewing? |
| 5 | **Universal** | Is it understood across cultures and demographics? |
| 6 | **Timeless** | Will it look dated in 5 years? |
| 7 | **Simple** | Is it concise, accurate, and balanced? |

**Scoring:** If a logo fails 2+ criteria, it needs redesign.

## 5 Core Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Clean, uncluttered. If you can't sketch it from memory, it's too complex.
2. **Originality** - Distinctive from competitors. Research industry before designing.
3. **Versatility** - Works at 16px favicon AND 10m billboard. B&W AND color.
4. **Timelessness** - Classic over trendy. Trends = 2-3 year shelf life. Principles = decades.
5. **Relevance** - Matches brand personality, industry expectations, and target audience.

## 7 Logo Types

| Type | What | Best For | Examples |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| **Wordmark** | Full brand name in custom typography | Distinctive names, established brands | Google, Coca-Cola |
| **Lettermark** | Initials/abbreviation | Long company names | IBM, NASA, HBO |
| **Pictorial** | Recognizable icon/symbol | Universal recognition goal | Apple, Twitter |
| **Abstract** | Geometric form, no literal meaning | Tech, innovation, complex services | Pepsi, Airbnb |
| **Emblem** | Text inside symbol/badge | Heritage, authority, trust | Starbucks, Harley-Davidson |
| **Combination** | Symbol + wordmark together | New brands needing both recognition paths | Burger King, Lacoste |
| **Mascot** | Character/figure | Friendly, family-oriented brands | KFC, Mailchimp |

**Decision guide:**
- New brand, unknown name -> **Combination** (builds both name and symbol recognition)
- SaaS/tech startup -> **Wordmark** or **Abstract** (modern, scalable, works as app icon)
- Long name -> **Lettermark** (abbreviate for memorability)
- Established with strong name -> **Wordmark** (let typography do the work)

## Professional Process (8 Steps)

### 1. Creative Brief
Define before designing:
- Brand values, mission, personality (3-5 adjectives)
- Target audience (age, industry, preferences)
- Competitors (what to differentiate from)
- Usage context (app icon, print, signage, merch)
- Mood/style preferences (modern, classic, playful, serious)
- Mandatory elements (if any)

### 2. Research & Discovery
- Audit competitor logos in the space
- Create mood boards (Pinterest, Dribbble, Behance)
- Identify visual patterns in the industry
- Find differentiation opportunities

### 3. Sketching
- **50-200+ rough hand sketches** (quantity breeds quality)
- Explore multiple directions, don't commit early
- Focus on shapes and forms, not details
- Narrow to 3-5 strongest concepts

### 4. Vectorization
- Recreate chosen sketches in vector (Illustrator/Figma)
- Refine curves, proportions, spacing
- Apply golden ratio grid if appropriate (1.618 proportions)
- Test optical balance (visual center vs mathematical center)

### 5. The B&W Test
> "If it doesn't work in black and white, it doesn't work." - Paul Rand

Test logo WITHOUT color first. Color is enhancement, not crutch.

### 6. Color & Typography
- Apply color psychology (see reference below)
- Max 2-3 colors (95% of top brands use 2)
- Select/customize typography that matches brand personality
- Create primary + secondary + monochrome versions

### 7. Context Testing
Present in realistic mockups:
- Business card, letterhead
- App icon (small scale)
- Website header
- Social media avatar (circle crop)
- Signage (large scale)
- Dark and light backgrounds

### 8. Final Delivery
Deliver complete asset library:
- Formats: SVG, AI/EPS, PNG (transparent), JPG
- Versions: Full color, monochrome, reversed (white on dark), icon-only
- Brand guidelines document: spacing rules, minimum size, color codes, don'ts

## Color Psychology Quick Reference

| Color | Evokes | Industries | Examples |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Blue** | Trust, reliability, calm | Finance, tech, healthcare | Facebook, Samsung, PayPal |
| **Red** | Energy, urgency, passion | Retail, food, entertainment | Coca-Cola, YouTube, Netflix |
| **Green** | Growth, health, nature | Eco, finance, health | Spotify, Whole Foods, Starbucks |
| **Yellow** | Optimism, warmth, attention | Food, energy, kids | McDonald's, IKEA, Snapchat |
| **Orange** | Creativity, friendly, bold | Tech, food, youth | Amazon, Fanta, Soundcloud |
| **Purple** | Luxury, wisdom, creative | Beauty, luxury, education | Cadbury, Twitch, Yahoo |
| **Black** | Elegance, power, premium | Luxury, fashion, tech | Nike, Chanel, Apple |
| **Pink** | Playful, feminine, warm | Beauty, fashion, dating | Barbie, T-Mobile, Lyft |

**Rules:**
- Max 2-3 colors in logo
- Test for color blindness accessibility (8% of men are color blind)
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Define exact color codes (HEX, RGB, CMYK, Pantone)

## Typography Psychology

| Category | Conveys | Use For |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Serif** (Times, Garamond) | Tradition, trust, authority | Law, finance, luxury, publishing |
| **Sans-serif** (Helvetica, Inter) | Modern, clean, approachable | Tech, startups, healthcare |
| **Script** (Pacifico, Allura) | Elegance, personal, creative | Beauty, fashion, wedding, food |
| **Slab serif** (Rockwell, Courier) | Strong, confident, reliable | Manufacturing, construction, sports |
| **Display/Custom** | Unique, bold, memorable | Entertainment, brands seeking differentiation |

**Best practice:** Custom or modified typography > stock fonts. Modification = competitive moat.

## Shape Psychology

| Shape | Conveys | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Circles** | Community, unity, wholeness, infinity | Target, BMW, Olympics |
| **Squares/Rectangles** | Stability, reliability, strength, order | Microsoft, BBC, National Geographic |
| **Triangles** | Dynamic, power, innovation, direction | Adidas, Delta, Google Play |
| **Organic/Curves** | Approachability, creativity, nature | Airbnb, Instagram |
| **Lines (horizontal)** | Calm, stability, tranquility | IBM stripes, AT&T |
| **Lines (vertical)** | Strength, ambition, progress | Cisco, SoundCloud |

## Lessons from Masters

| Designer | Iconic Work | Key Lesson |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Paul Rand** | IBM, UPS, NeXT | Geometric simplicity. Test with 7-step criteria. |
| **Saul Bass** | AT&T, United Airlines | Minimum elements = maximum lifespan (34+ yr avg) |
| **Milton Glaser** | I ❤ NY | Rebus engages viewer. Participation = memorability. |
| **Rob Janoff** | Apple (1977) | Single distinctive detail (bite) = instant recognition at any scale |
| **Carolyn Davidson** | Nike Swoosh | Movement in simplest form. Great logos can be one stroke. |
| **Lindon Leader** | FedEx | Negative space is a design tool, not empty space. |
| **Michael Bierut** | Mastercard rebrand | Courage to simplify. Remove text when symbol is strong enough. |

## AI-Assisted Logo Workflow

For founders/non-designers:

### Exploration Phase
1. **Midjourney/DALL-E:** Generate 20-50 concept variations
   - Prompt: "minimalist logo for [brand], [industry], [2-3 adjectives], vector style, flat design"
   - Iterate on promising directions
   - Use as inspiration, NOT final output

2. **Evaluate** against Paul Rand's 7-step test
3. **Select** 2-3 strongest directions

### Production Phase
4. **Vectorize:** Recreate in Figma/Illustrator (AI output is raster, not production-ready)
5. **Refine:** Adjust proportions, clean curves, perfect spacing
6. **B&W test:** Strip color, verify it works
7. **Color apply:** Use psychology reference above
8. **Export:** All formats and versions

**Critical:** AI generates inspiration. The last 10% of refinement is what separates amateur from professional.

### Tools
| Tool | Best For | Skill Level |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Canva** | Quick logos, templates | Beginner |
| **Figma** | Vector design, iteration, collaboration | Intermediate |
| **Adobe Illustrator** | Professional vector production | Advanced |
| **Midjourney/DALL-E** | Concept exploration | Any (prompting skill) |
| **Looka/Hatchful** | AI logo generators (limited customization) | Beginner |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Too many colors (4+) | Cluttered, expensive to reproduce | Max 2-3 colors |
| Following trends | Dated in 2-3 years | Prioritize timelessness |
| Too complex/detailed | Fails at small sizes, hard to remember | Simplify until you can sketch from memory |
| Raster not vector | Can't scale, pixelates | Always design in vector (SVG/AI) |
| Stock fonts unmodified | Looks generic, no differentiation | Customize or commission typography |
| No B&W version | Fails in fax, engrave, single-color print | Design B&W first, add color second |
| Copying competitors | Looks derivative, legal risk | Research competitors to DIFFERENTIATE |
| Designing by committee | Diluted, compromised, bland | One decision-maker, clear brief |
| Skipping mockup testing | Looks great on screen, fails in context | Test in 5+ real-world applications |
| Ignoring negative space | Misses opportunities for hidden meaning | Study FedEx, Spartan Golf Club |
