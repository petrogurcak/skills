# Growth Hacking

## Overview

This skill provides frameworks for systematic, data-driven growth using methodologies from Sean Ellis & Morgan Brown's "Hacking Growth". Use when you need to prioritize experiments and drive sustainable growth.

**Announce:** "I'm using growth-hacking to set up systematic experimentation for growth."

## When to Use

**USE this skill:**
- "How do I grow faster?"
- "Which marketing channel should I try first?"
- "Do I have product-market fit?"
- Prioritizing growth experiments
- Setting up growth process
- Measuring if product is "must-have"

**DON'T use this skill:**
- Creating offers → `offer-creation`
- Positioning → `uvp-optimization`
- Product onboarding → `product-led-growth`
- SaaS metrics → `saas-bootstrap`

## Iron Law

```
NO GROWTH WITHOUT PRODUCT-MARKET FIT

Don't pour water into a leaky bucket.
First validate PMF with Must-Have Survey.
If <40% "very disappointed" → fix product first.
```

## Core Frameworks

### Framework 1: Must-Have Survey (PMF Validation)

**Purpose:** Determine if you have Product-Market Fit before scaling.

**The Question:**
> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
> - Very disappointed
> - Somewhat disappointed
> - Not disappointed
> - N/A (no longer use it)

**Interpretation:**
| Very Disappointed % | PMF Status | Action |
|--------------------|------------|--------|
| 40%+ | PMF achieved | Scale growth |
| 25-40% | Almost there | Improve core value |
| <25% | No PMF | Pivot or major changes |

**When to use:**
- Before scaling marketing spend
- Before hiring growth team
- When unsure if product resonates
- Quarterly health check

**Additional questions to ask:**
1. "What type of person would benefit most from [product]?"
2. "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?"
3. "How can we improve [product] for you?"

### Framework 2: Growth Hacking Process

**Purpose:** Systematic cycle for continuous growth experimentation.

**The Cycle:**

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   ANALYZE   │ ← Data collection, insights
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           ▼
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   IDEATE    │ ← Generate experiment ideas
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           ▼
    ┌─────────────┐
    │ PRIORITIZE  │ ← Score with ICE
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           ▼
    ┌─────────────┐
    │    TEST     │ ← Run experiments
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
           └──────────→ Back to ANALYZE
```

**Phase Details:**

**1. ANALYZE**
- What do the numbers say?
- Where is the biggest drop-off?
- What patterns emerge from user behavior?
- What qualitative feedback exists?

**2. IDEATE**
- Brainstorm without judgment
- Quantity over quality initially
- Cross-functional input (product, marketing, sales, support)
- Document every idea in backlog

**3. PRIORITIZE**
- Use ICE scoring (see Framework 3)
- Weekly prioritization meeting
- Select top 3-5 experiments for the week

**4. TEST**
- Define hypothesis clearly
- Set success metrics upfront
- Run for statistical significance
- Document learnings regardless of outcome

---

### Framework 3: ICE Scoring

**Purpose:** Objectively prioritize experiment ideas.

**Formula:**
```
ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3
```

**Scoring (1-10 scale):**

| Dimension | What it measures | Scoring Guide |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Impact** | Expected effect on key metric | 10 = 10x improvement, 1 = tiny effect |
| **Confidence** | How sure are we it'll work? | 10 = data-backed, 1 = pure guess |
| **Ease** | Resources/time to implement | 10 = <1 day, 1 = months of work |

**Example Scoring:**

| Experiment | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE |
|------------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| New headline A/B test | 7 | 6 | 9 | 7.3 |
| Complete redesign | 9 | 4 | 2 | 5.0 |
| Add testimonials | 5 | 8 | 8 | 7.0 |
| Build referral system | 8 | 5 | 3 | 5.3 |

**Priority:** Headline test (7.3) > Testimonials (7.0) > Referral (5.3) > Redesign (5.0)

---

### Framework 4: North Star Metric

**Purpose:** Single metric that captures core value delivery.

**Characteristics of good North Star:**
- Measures value delivered to customers
- Leading indicator of revenue
- Everyone can influence it
- Simple to understand

**Examples by business type:**

| Business Type | North Star Metric |
|---------------|-------------------|
| SaaS | Weekly Active Users |
| Marketplace | Transactions completed |
| E-commerce | Purchases per month |
| Media | Time spent reading |
| Freemium | Free-to-paid conversion |

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: PMF Check

Before any growth work:
```
1. Run Must-Have Survey
2. If <40% "very disappointed" → STOP growth, fix product
3. If 40%+ → proceed to growth process
```

### Phase 2: Setup Growth Process

**Weekly cadence:**
- Monday: Analyze previous week's experiments
- Tuesday: Ideation session
- Wednesday: ICE scoring and prioritization
- Thursday-Friday: Implementation and launch

### Phase 3: Run Experiments

For each experiment:
```markdown
## Experiment: [Name]

**Hypothesis:** We believe [change] will [effect] because [reasoning].

**Metric:** [What we're measuring]

**Success criteria:** [X]% improvement with 95% confidence

**Duration:** [X] days/weeks

**Result:** [Outcome + learnings]
```

### Phase 4: Learn and Iterate

- Document ALL learnings (wins and failures)
- Share across team
- Feed insights back into Analyze phase
- Update experiment backlog

---

## Quick Router

| Situation | Framework to Use |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Should we scale marketing?" | Must-Have Survey first |
| "Too many ideas, can't decide" | ICE Scoring |
| "Growth is random and chaotic" | Growth Process (weekly cadence) |
| "What metric should we focus on?" | North Star Metric |
| "Our experiments don't move needle" | Check if targeting right metric (North Star) |

---

## Growth Team Structure

**Minimum viable growth team:**
- Growth Lead (owns process)
- Engineer (implements)
- Data Analyst (measures)
- Designer (optional but helpful)

**Cross-functional input from:**
- Marketing
- Product
- Customer Support
- Sales

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping PMF validation:**
"Let's scale ads!" with no PMF data → Burning money.

**Over-optimizing for wrong metric:**
Increasing signups while ignoring activation → Vanity metrics.

**Not running experiments long enough:**
Stopping at 2 days → No statistical significance.

**HiPPO decisions:**
"CEO thinks we should..." → Use ICE scoring objectively.

**One experiment at a time:**
Serial testing is slow → Run parallel experiments on different funnels.

---

## Red Flags

**STOP and reassess if:**

- Must-Have Survey <25% → Product problem, not growth problem
- All experiments failing → Wrong hypothesis, wrong metric
- No clear North Star → Align team first
- No data infrastructure → Can't measure = can't grow

---

## Integration

**Before growth-hacking:**
- `uvp-optimization` → Clear positioning
- `offer-creation` → Compelling offer

**After growth experiments identify winners:**
- `ottocopy-web-copy` → Scale winning copy
- `product-led-growth` → Optimize onboarding
- `ux-optimization` → Implement UX improvements
