# SaaS Bootstrap

## Overview

This skill helps bootstrapped founders build sustainable SaaS businesses using frameworks from Rob Walling's "The SaaS Playbook". Use when you're building without external funding and need to be strategic about what to build and how to grow.

**Announce:** "I'm using saas-bootstrap to guide bootstrapped SaaS strategy."

## When to Use

**USE this skill:**
- "Should I build this SaaS idea?"
- "I'm a solo founder, what should I focus on?"
- "What metrics should I track?"
- "How do I grow without funding?"
- "Is my SaaS healthy?"
- Bootstrap vs VC decision

**DON'T use this skill:**
- Creating offers → `offer-creation`
- Growth experiments → `growth-hacking`
- Product onboarding → `product-led-growth`
- Positioning → `uvp-optimization`

## Iron Law

```
STAIR STEP > MOONSHOT

Build skills and capital with smaller products
before tackling complex, standalone SaaS.

Most first SaaS products fail.
Increase your odds by leveling up first.
```

## Core Frameworks

### Framework 1: Stair Step Method of Entrepreneurship

**Purpose:** Reduce risk by building skills, capital, and confidence progressively.

**The Steps:**

```
Step 3: Standalone SaaS
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  Full SaaS product          │
        │  Multiple channels          │
        │  Team building              │
        │  Full-time commitment       │
        └───────────────┬─────────────┘
                        │
Step 2: Repeat & Own Your Time
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  Multiple Step 1 products   │
        │  Income replaces job        │
        │  Skills refined             │
        │  Capital accumulated        │
        └───────────────┬─────────────┘
                        │
Step 1: Simple Product + Single Channel
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  WordPress plugin           │
        │  Shopify app                │
        │  Simple tool                │
        │  One organic channel        │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 1: First Product**
- Simple product (plugin, add-on, small tool)
- ONE organic acquisition channel (marketplace, SEO, community)
- Goal: Learn product development, marketing, support
- Examples: WordPress plugin, Shopify app, browser extension

**Step 2: Repeat Until Free**
- Build 2-3 Step 1 products
- Goal: Income matches or exceeds salary
- "Own your time" before taking big risks
- Continue learning, refine skills

**Step 3: Standalone SaaS**
- Now you have: skills, capital, runway, confidence
- Can survive longer without revenue
- Know what works in marketing
- Have support experience

**Why it works:**
- Lower risk at each step
- Learning compounds
- Capital from Step 1-2 funds Step 3
- Psychological safety to take bigger swings

### Framework 2: 3 High / 3 Low Metrics

**Purpose:** Monitor SaaS health with 6 key metrics.

**Keep HIGH:**

| Metric | What it means | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **ACV** (Annual Contract Value) | Average revenue per customer/year | Higher = easier growth |
| **Expansion Revenue** | Upsells, cross-sells, upgrades | 20%+ of new MRR |
| **Referrals** | Customers bringing customers | Track NPS, referral program |

**Keep LOW:**

| Metric | What it means | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Cost to acquire one customer | < 1/3 of LTV |
| **Sales Effort** | Human time per sale | Lower = more scalable |
| **Churn** | Customers leaving | < 5% monthly (B2C), < 2% monthly (B2B) |

**Health Check:**

| Status | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| Healthy | High ACV, Low Churn, Positive expansion |
| Warning | Rising CAC, Flat expansion, Increasing churn |
| Critical | CAC > ACV, High churn, No expansion |

**Ratio to track:**
```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost

< 3:1 → Unsustainable, fix CAC or churn
3:1 → Healthy
> 5:1 → Opportunity to invest more in growth
```

### Framework 3: Market Selection

**Purpose:** Choose markets where bootstrappers can win.

**Ideal market characteristics:**

| Factor | Why it matters | What to look for |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Niche** | Less competition | Specific vertical or use case |
| **Willingness to pay** | Revenue potential | Already paying for solutions |
| **Reachable** | Marketing feasibility | Clear communities, channels |
| **Growing** | Long-term potential | Industry trends upward |
| **No 800-lb gorilla** | Competitive landscape | No dominant player |

**Red flag markets for bootstrappers:**
- Consumer (low willingness to pay)
- Heavy enterprise (long sales cycles, need team)
- Dominated by VC-backed competitors
- Requires network effects to work

**Good bootstrap markets:**
- B2B SMB (businesses with budget, clear pain)
- Developers (will pay for tools that save time)
- Professional services (dentists, lawyers, agencies)
- E-commerce merchants (track ROI easily)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Assess Current Position

```
Where are you now?
[ ] Step 1: First product (building skills)
[ ] Step 2: Multiple products (building income)
[ ] Step 3: Standalone SaaS (scaling)
```

### Phase 2: For Step 1 Products

1. Find marketplace with demand (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
2. Identify problem people are paying to solve
3. Build simple solution
4. Launch and learn
5. Support customers, iterate

### Phase 3: Track 3H/3L Metrics

Set up dashboard:
```
HIGH Metrics:
- ACV: $___/year
- Expansion MRR: $___/month (___% of new)
- Referrals: ___/month

LOW Metrics:
- CAC: $___/customer
- Sales effort: ___ hours/sale
- Churn: ___% monthly
```

### Phase 4: Health Assessment

Monthly review:
- [ ] Is ACV increasing or stable?
- [ ] Is expansion happening?
- [ ] Is CAC sustainable (<1/3 LTV)?
- [ ] Is churn under control?
- [ ] Are customers referring?

## Quick Router

| Situation | Framework to Use |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Should I quit my job to build SaaS?" | Stair Step (probably Step 1-2 first) |
| "Is my SaaS healthy?" | 3 High / 3 Low Metrics |
| "What market should I target?" | Market Selection criteria |
| "I keep failing at SaaS" | Stair Step (start simpler) |
| "My churn is killing growth" | Focus on LOW metrics (churn) |

| Growing | | |
| No dominant player | | |
| **Total** | /25 | |

- 15-19: Good, proceed with caution
- 10-14: Challenging, reconsider
- <10: Avoid
```

## Common Mistakes

**Going straight to Step 3:**
"I'll build a big SaaS" without experience → High failure rate.

**Ignoring churn:**
"I'll grow past it" → Leaky bucket never fills.

**Competing on price:**
"I'll be cheaper" → Race to bottom, unsustainable CAC.

**Targeting consumers:**
"Everyone needs this!" → Low willingness to pay, high support.

**No niche:**
"It's for all businesses" → Can't reach anyone effectively.

---

## Red Flags

**STOP and reassess if:**

- Churn > 10% monthly → Product or market problem
- CAC > ACV → Unsustainable
- No expansion possible → Limited LTV
- Can't reach customers affordably → Wrong market
- 6+ months, no traction → Pivot or step back

---

## Bootstrap vs VC Decision

**Bootstrap if:**
- Market is niche (not big enough for VC)
- Can be profitable with small team
- Want to own 100%
- Prefer slow, sustainable growth
- Have runway from other income

**Consider VC if:**
- Winner-take-all market
- Network effects critical
- Speed to market essential
- Need large team quickly
- Comfortable with dilution

---

## Integration

**Works with:**
- `growth-hacking` → ICE scoring for experiments
- `offer-creation` → Value equation for pricing
- `product-led-growth` → Self-serve optimization
- `uvp-optimization` → Niche positioning

**Sequence for new bootstrapped SaaS:**
1. `saas-bootstrap` → Stair Step assessment
2. `uvp-optimization` → Positioning for niche
3. `offer-creation` → Compelling offer
4. `growth-hacking` → Systematic acquisition
5. `saas-bootstrap` → 3H/3L monitoring
