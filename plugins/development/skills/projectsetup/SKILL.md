name: projectsetup
description: Creates CLAUDE.md and .claude/ directory with development principles (TDD, Git safety, verification, checkpoints), session context files, and MCP server configuration. Supports Generic, Nette, Flutter, and Frontend variants. Use when user says "setup this project", "initialize project", or when starting a new project without CLAUDE.md. NOT for adding workflow optimizations to an existing setup (use workflow-optimization) or for framework-specific implementation (use framework workflow skills).

# 🚀 Project Setup Skill

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- User says "Setup this project" or "Initialize this project"
- User says "Configure development environment"
- User says "Setup Claude for this project"
- Empty or new project directory (no CLAUDE.md exists)

## What This Skill Does

**Creates development principles structure:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Entry point with quick reference + **development-workflow** skill reference
- `.claude/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` - 14 core principles (TDD, Git, Verification, Designing Abstractions, etc.)
- `.claude/WORKFLOWS.md` - TDD workflow, Bug Fix, Git operations
- `.claude/CHECKPOINTS.md` - When to ask vs auto
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Project permissions
- `.claude/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` - Session context (where you left off)
- `.claude/DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decisions log

**Integrates with workflow orchestration:**

- `CLAUDE.md` includes reference to `development-workflow` skill
- This skill orchestrates: Brainstorming → Planning → Framework-specific implementation → Review
- Ensures proper skill sequence for all feature implementations

**Supports 4 variants:**

- **Generic** - Framework-free, pure principles (TDD, Git, Verification)
- **Nette** - Integrates with nette-workflow.skill + principles
- **Flutter** - Integrates with flutter-workflow.skill + principles
- **Frontend** - Integrates with frontend-workflow.skill + principles

## Important Notes

**This skill creates PRINCIPLES, not framework workflows:**

- ✅ TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- ✅ Git Safety (Branch first, ask before commit)
- ✅ Verification (Tests + Static analysis mandatory)
- ✅ Checkpoints (When to ask vs auto)
- ✅ False Positive Prevention

**Framework-specific workflows are in separate skills:**

- `nette-workflow.skill` - Nette development + MANDATORY docs-first
- `flutter-workflow.skill` - Flutter development + MANDATORY docs-first
- `frontend-workflow.skill` - Frontend development + MANDATORY docs-first

## Process

### Step 1: Detect Context

Check if setup is needed:

```
Is there CLAUDE.md in current directory?
├─ NO → Continue to Step 2
└─ YES → Ask: "CLAUDE.md exists. Overwrite? (yes/no)"
           ├─ yes → Continue to Step 2
           └─ no → Stop
```

### Step 2: Ask Variant

```
❓ Which project type?

   A) Generic (Framework-free)
      → Pure principles: TDD, Git safety, Verification
      → No framework-specific rules
      → Works with ANY tech stack

   B) Nette (PHP + Latte + Tracy)
      → Principles + Nette critical rules
      → Integration with nette-workflow.skill
      → Commands: composer test, phpstan

   C) Flutter (Dart + Flutter)
      → Principles + Flutter critical rules
      → Integration with flutter-workflow.skill
      → Commands: flutter test, flutter analyze

   D) Frontend (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Alpine)
      → Principles + Frontend critical rules
      → Integration with frontend-workflow.skill
      → Commands: npm test, npm run lint

   Choice (A/B/C/D):

[WAIT FOR ANSWER]
```

### Step 2.5: Select MCP Servers

**Purpose:** Prevent context bloat by enabling only relevant MCP servers per project.

**Registry:** `~/.claude/mcp-registry.yaml` contains all available servers with categories and variant mappings.

```
1. Read ~/.claude/mcp-registry.yaml
2. Filter servers by chosen variant (Step 2):
   - Show servers where `variant` matches chosen type
   - Show all servers without `variant` (universal)
   - Mark `phase: true` servers separately
3. Present to user:

❓ Which MCP servers for this project?

   Recommended for [variant]:
   [x] nette-mcp - Nette PHP framework documentation
   [ ] code-mode - Complex TypeScript workflows

   Monitoring (enable if needed):
   [ ] sentry - Sentry error tracking
   [ ] stripe - Stripe payments

   Phase-based (activate later when needed):
   ℹ google-analytics - GA4 reporting (use: mcp-activate.sh add google-analytics)
   ℹ gtm - Google Tag Manager (use: mcp-activate.sh add gtm)
   ℹ notebooklm - NotebookLM queries (use: mcp-activate.sh add notebooklm)
   ℹ claude-in-chrome - Browser automation (use: mcp-activate.sh add claude-in-chrome)

   [WAIT FOR ANSWER - user selects which permanent servers to enable]

4. For each selected server, run:
   claude mcp add --scope project <server-name> -- <command> <args>
   (or --transport http for HTTP servers)

5. This creates .mcp.json in project root with project-scoped servers

6. Generate Gemini CLI MCP config (dual-CLI parity):
   ~/.claude/scripts/sync-mcp-to-gemini.sh

   This creates .gemini/settings.json from .mcp.json so the same MCP servers
   are available when switching between Claude Code and Gemini CLI in this project.
```

**Important:** Phase-based servers are NOT added during setup. User activates them on-demand:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/mcp-activate.sh add google-analytics   # when doing analytics
~/.claude/scripts/mcp-activate.sh remove google-analytics # when done
```

### Step 3: Create Files

Based on choice, copy template files from skill directory:

**Template source locations:**

- Generic: `~/.claude/skills/project-setup/templates/generic/`
- Nette: `~/.claude/skills/project-setup/templates/nette/`
- Flutter: `~/.claude/skills/project-setup/templates/flutter/`
- Frontend: `~/.claude/skills/project-setup/templates/frontend/`

**Files to copy for each variant:**

1. `CLAUDE.md` → Current directory
2. `.claude/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` → Create `.claude/` directory first
3. `.claude/WORKFLOWS.md`
4. `.claude/CHECKPOINTS.md`
5. `.claude/settings.local.json`
6. `.claude/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` → Session context template
7. `.claude/DECISIONS.md` → Decisions log template

**Process:**

```
1. Create `.claude/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Read template files from appropriate variant directory
3. Write files to current project directory
8. If user wants Playwright scaffold:
   - Copy files from templates/playwright-scaffold/ to current project
   - Run: npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium
```

### Step 4: Inform User

```
✅ Project setup complete!

Created files:
- CLAUDE.md
- .claude/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md
- .claude/WORKFLOWS.md
- .claude/CHECKPOINTS.md
- .claude/settings.local.json
- .claude/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
- .claude/DECISIONS.md

Project type: [Generic/Nette/Flutter/Frontend]

MCP servers configured:
- Project-scoped: [list of enabled servers]
- Phase-based (activate when needed):
  - `~/.claude/scripts/mcp-activate.sh add <name>` to enable
  - `~/.claude/scripts/mcp-activate.sh remove <name>` to disable
  - `~/.claude/scripts/mcp-activate.sh list` to see available

Session context enabled:
- .claude/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md - tracks where you left off + workflow maturity
- .claude/DECISIONS.md - logs architectural decisions
- Context loads automatically at session start
- Use `session-context` skill for manual control

Next steps:
1. Read CLAUDE.md for quick reference
2. Customize Section 8 in CORE_PRINCIPLES.md if needed
3. Start developing with: "Use development-workflow skill to implement [feature]"

Want to add Playwright e2e scaffold?
→ Yes: I'll create e2e/ directory structure with Playwright config and fixtures
→ No: You can add it later manually

Want to add workflow optimization (mistakes tracking, verification checklist, code quality hooks)?
→ Yes: I'll run workflow-optimization skill now
→ No: You can add it later with "Use workflow-optimization skill"

Active skills for development:
- development-workflow ← Orchestrates: Brainstorming → Planning → Implementation → Review
- [If framework:] [nette-framework/flutter-workflow/frontend-workflow] ← Executes implementation with docs-first TDD

Workflow sequence:
User: "Use development-workflow skill to implement [feature]"
→ Brainstorming (design phase)
→ Write plan (task breakdown)
→ Framework skill execution (docs-first + TDD + verification)
→ Code review (validation)
→ Finishing branch (merge/PR)
```
