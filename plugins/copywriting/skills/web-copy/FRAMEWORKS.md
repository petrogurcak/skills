## Eugene Schwartz: 5 Awareness Stages

**Source:** Breakthrough Advertising (1966), Eugene Schwartz
**Impact:** WSJ sales letter based on this → $1-2 billion revenue over 28 years

### Core Principle

**Customer awareness level determines messaging strategy.**

Wrong awareness targeting = immediate bounce, no matter how good the copy.

**Common mistake:** Writing "Product Aware" copy for "Problem Aware" audience
**Result:** Premature pitch → distrust → exit

---

### The 5 Stages (Ví prd → Ready to Buy)

#### Stage 1: UNAWARE (Ví prd)

**Charakteristika:**

- Netuší že má problém
- Nepřišel hledat řešení
- Přišel z obsahu nesouvisejícího s vaším produktem (social media, blog, viral content)

**Messaging Strategy:**

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Pitch produkt
- ❌ Nabízet řešení
- ❌ Mluvit o features

**DO:**

- ✅ Content marketing nesouvisející přímo s produktem
- ✅ Educational / entertainment value
- ✅ Vytvořit problem awareness subtilně
- ✅ Build brand familiarity

**Example:**

- **Bad:** "Kup náš CRM software" (они не ví že potřebují CRM)
- **Good:** "5 signálů že ztrácíte zákazníky" (blog post který subtilně ukazuje CRM symptoms)

**Conversion Goal:** Unaware → Problem Aware (ne direct sale)

---

#### Stage 2: PROBLEM AWARE

**Charakteristika:**

- Ví že něco je špatně
- Hledá pochopení problému
- Neví že vy existujete
- Search queries: "How to...", "Why is my...", "What causes..."

**Messaging Strategy:**

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Pitch váš specifický produkt
- ❌ Competitor comparison
- ❌ Aggressive CTAs

**DO:**

- ✅ Educational content (neutral, objective)
- ✅ Explain problem thoroughly
- ✅ Present multiple solution categories (yours is one option)
- ✅ Establish credibility / thought leadership
- ✅ Subtle brand mentions

**Example:**

- **Bad:** "Our AI chatbot reduces support tickets 60%" (premature pitch)
- **Good:** "3 approaches to reducing support workload: Hiring, outsourcing, automation" (neutral comparison with your category mentioned)

**Conversion Goal:** Problem Aware → Solution Aware

**Content Types:**

- Blog posts (in-depth guides)
- Webinars (educational, 90% teaching / 10% pitch)
- Free tools (calculators, assessments)
- Research reports

---

#### Stage 3: SOLUTION AWARE

**Charakteristika:**

- Zná různé kategorie řešení
- Evaluates approaches
- Neví o všech dostupných produktech
- Search queries: "Best [solution type]", "[Solution] vs [Solution]"

**Messaging Strategy:**

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Assume they know your brand
- ❌ Feature-dump immediately

**DO:**

- ✅ Content marketing (tutorials, comparisons, demos)
- ✅ Build audience (email list, retargeting)
- ✅ Show your solution working
- ✅ Differentiate your approach (not just product)
- ✅ Case studies (without hard sell)

**Example:**

- **Bad:** "Sign up now!" (они не знают о vás)
- **Good:** "How [Your Approach] reduces costs vs traditional methods" (category comparison with your method winning)

**Conversion Goal:** Solution Aware → Product Aware

**Content Types:**

- Comparison guides ("Live chat vs chatbots vs help desk")
- Video tutorials showing your approach
- Free trials / demos (low-commitment exploration)
- Webinars with live demos

---

#### Stage 4: PRODUCT AWARE

**Charakteristika:**

- Zná váš produkt + konkurenční produkty
- Srovnává specifické features/pricing
- Má námitky (price, effort, risk, timing)
- Search queries: "[Your Brand] review", "[Your Brand] vs [Competitor]"

**Messaging Strategy:**

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Educate on problem/solution (already know)
- ❌ Generic benefits

**DO:**

- ✅ Address specific objections
- ✅ Testimonials with quantified results
- ✅ Guarantees (money-back, risk reversal)
- ✅ Cialdini persuasion principles (social proof, scarcity, authority)
- ✅ Differentiation (why you vs competitors)
- ✅ Strong CTAs with urgency

**Example:**

- **Bad:** "We help teams collaborate" (already know this)
- **Good:** "30-day money-back guarantee. 5,000+ teams switched from [Competitor]. Set up in 15 minutes."

**Conversion Goal:** Product Aware → Most Aware (purchase decision)

**Content Types:**

- Product comparison pages
- Customer testimonials (video preferred)
- Pricing page with FAQ addressing objections
- Case studies with ROI data
- Free trial with onboarding support

**Common Objections to Address:**

| Objection                          | Counter-Strategy                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Too expensive"**                | ROI calculator, cost comparison, payment plans                 |
| **"Takes too long to implement"**  | "Set up in X minutes" proof, onboarding support                |
| **"What if it doesn't work?"**     | Money-back guarantee, free trial, case studies                 |
| **"Why now?"**                     | Limited-time offer, scarcity (seats/pricing), cost of inaction |
| **"Not sure it fits my use case"** | Multiple case studies, vertical-specific examples              |

---

#### Stage 5: MOST AWARE

**Charakteristika:**

- Rozhodnutý koupit VÁŠ produkt
- Hledá poslední details (pricing, implementation)
- Možná čeká na trigger (budget approval, timing)

**Messaging Strategy:**

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Sell (už jsou přesvědčení)
- ❌ Long-form persuasion

**DO:**

- ✅ Remove friction
- ✅ Facilitate purchase (clear pricing, simple checkout)
- ✅ Urgency if appropriate (limited-time discount)
- ✅ Onboarding clarity ("What happens after I buy?")

**Example:**

- **Bad:** Long sales page re-explaining benefits
- **Good:** "Start now. $99/month. Cancel anytime. Questions? Chat with us."

**Conversion Goal:** Purchase completion

**Page Elements:**

- Clear pricing (no hidden costs)
- Simple form (min fields)
- Multiple payment options
- Trust badges (security, guarantees)
- Live chat for last-minute questions
- Post-purchase clarity ("You'll receive access in 5 minutes")

## Awareness Stage Diagnostic

**How to determine audience awareness level:**

### Method 1: Search Query Analysis

| Query Type                       | Awareness Stage |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| "How to [achieve outcome]"       | Problem Aware   |
| "Best [solution category]"       | Solution Aware  |
| "[Your Brand] vs [Competitor]"   | Product Aware   |
| "[Your Brand] pricing"           | Most Aware      |
| "Why is my [symptom]"            | Problem Aware   |
| "[Solution category] comparison" | Solution Aware  |

### Method 2: Traffic Source Analysis

| Source                           | Likely Awareness         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Organic search (problem queries) | Problem Aware            |
| Organic search (brand queries)   | Product/Most Aware       |
| Social media (viral content)     | Unaware                  |
| Paid ads (retargeting)           | Product Aware            |
| Email (nurture sequence)         | Solution → Product Aware |
| Direct traffic                   | Most Aware               |
| Competitor comparison sites      | Product Aware            |

### Method 3: User Interview Question

**Ask new signups/customers:**

"Když jste poprvé našli naši stránku, co jste přesně hledali?"

**Answers reveal:**

- "Didn't know I needed this, saw your post" → Unaware
- "Ways to reduce [problem]" → Problem Aware
- "Different types of [solution]" → Solution Aware
- "Comparing you to [Competitor]" → Product Aware
- "Your pricing page" → Most Aware

## The WSJ Case Study: $2 Billion Sales Letter

**Author:** Martin Conroy (1975)
**Product:** Wall Street Journal subscription
**Result:** $1-2 billion revenue over 28 years (estimated)
**Medium:** Direct mail sales letter

### Why It Worked

**Key Insight:** Didn't target demographic persona (age, income, family status)

**Instead:** Targeted **actual motivations and problems**

**Opening (famous two-young-men story):**

> "On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young men... Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They were still very much alike... But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small department of that company. The other was its president."

**Breakdown:**

**1. Awareness Stage Targeting:** Solution Aware → Product Aware

- Audience already knew staying informed = career advantage
- WSJ positioned as THE solution for business intelligence

**2. Emotional Hook:** Status anxiety + aspiration

- Two similar men, drastically different outcomes
- Reader identifies with manager, aspires to president

**3. Mechanism Revealed:** "The difference? [Information access]"

- Not talent, not luck → **what you know**
- WSJ = information edge

**4. Risk Reversal:** Money-back guarantee prominently featured

**5. Specific Benefits:** Not "stay informed" but "make better decisions, advance faster, earn more"

### Lesson for Modern Copy

**DON'T:**

- Write for "35-year-old male, $80k income, married with kids"

**DO:**

- Write for "person who feels stuck in career, sees peers advancing, suspects they're missing critical information"

**Motivation > Demographics**

## Schwartz's 8 Writing Principles

From "Breakthrough Advertising" (1966) and copywriting career insights:

### 1. Be an Exceptional Listener

**Principle:** Great copy comes from deep audience understanding, not clever writing.

**Application:**

- Interview customers extensively (Groove: 40+ interviews)
- Read support tickets, reviews, forum posts
- Note exact phrases they use

**Example:**

- Customer says: "I hate spending 3 hours sorting emails"
- Use their words: "Reduce email sorting from 3 hours to 15 minutes"

---

### 2. Work Intensely in Short Bursts

**Principle:** Quality copy requires deep focus, not marathon sessions.

**Application:**

- Write in 60-90 minute focused blocks
- Break between sections
- Fresh eyes = better critique

**Schwartz's method:**

- 3-4 hours/day maximum writing time
- Rest of day: research, editing, thinking

---

### 3. Never Invent—Combine Existing Product Details Deeply Understood

**Principle:** Innovation in copy = new combinations of true product attributes, not fabrication.

**Application:**

- List all product features/benefits
- Find unexpected connections
- Combine in novel ways

**Example:**

- Feature A: "Cloud storage"
- Feature B: "Real-time sync"
- **Combination:** "Never lose work even if laptop dies mid-sentence" (new angle, true claim)

---

### 4. Write for the Reptile Brain (Piš pro ještěrčí mozek)

**Principle:** Humans make decisions emotionally (reptile brain), then rationalize logically (neocortex).

**Application:**

- Lead with emotion/desire/fear
- Support with logic/data
- Simple, direct language (not corporate speak)

**Brain Hierarchy:**

1. **Reptile (survival, pleasure, pain):** "Reduce costs 60%" / "Never lose a lead again"
2. **Limbic (emotion, memory):** "Remember when you lost that $50k deal because..."
3. **Neocortex (logic, analysis):** "Our algorithm uses XYZ methodology..."

**Structure:** Hook reptile → engage limbic → satisfy neocortex

**Example:**

- ❌ "Our platform leverages advanced NLP algorithms" (neocortex only)
- ✅ "Stop losing customers to slow responses" (reptile) → "AI responds in 30 seconds" (neocortex)

---

### 5. Don't Sell; Guide Existing Demand Toward Your Solution

**Principle:** You can't create desire. You can only channel existing desire toward your product.

**Application:**

- Find what people already want
- Position your product as the path to that desire
- Don't convince them to want something new

**Schwartz quote:**

> "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already existing desires onto a particular product."

**Example:**

- ❌ "You should want to automate customer support" (creating desire)
- ✅ "You already hate repetitive support tickets. Here's how to eliminate 60% of them." (channeling existing desire)

---

### 6. Show What It Does, Not What It Is

**Principle:** Benefits (outcomes) beat features (attributes).

**Formula:** Feature → Benefit Translation

**Application:**

| Feature (What It Is)     | Benefit (What It Does)                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "AI-powered chatbot"     | "Answers customers instantly, 24/7"                      |
| "Cloud-based CRM"        | "Access customer data anywhere, never lose a lead"       |
| "256-bit encryption"     | "Your data is unhackable"                                |
| "Inline form validation" | "Users fix mistakes before submitting, 60% fewer errors" |

**Advanced:** Show what it does FOR THEM specifically

- ❌ "Reduces support tickets"
- ✅ "Your support team handles 60% fewer tickets, freeing 20 hours/week for growth projects"

---

### 7. Deliver Immediate Gratification in Benefits

**Principle:** Brains discount future rewards. Emphasize immediate wins.

**Application:**

- Lead with quick wins, not long-term vision
- Specify timeframes ("in 15 minutes" not "eventually")
- Show before/after (immediate contrast)

**Example:**

- ❌ "Over time, you'll see productivity improvements"
- ✅ "See your first automated response in 5 minutes. 50% fewer tickets by end of week."

**Data:**

- Immediate benefits: +30% conversion vs future-focused (CXL Institute)

---

### 8. Fail Often; Test Major Changes and Iterate

**Principle:** First draft is never the winner. A/B test major variations.

**Application:**

- Write 3-5 headline variations minimum
- Test radically different approaches (not minor tweaks)
- Let data decide

**Schwartz's process:**

- Write 50+ headlines per project
- Narrow to top 5-10
- Test winners

**Example (Groove case study):**

- Tested 50+ headline variations
- Winner: +104% conversion vs original

**See:** `ux-optimization/practices/ab-testing.md` for testing methodology

## Practical Application: The Eskimo vs Jamaican Example

**Scenario:** Selling snow to two different audiences

### Selling to an Eskimo (Product Aware)

**Context:**

- Lives in snow
- Knows what snow is (solution aware)
- Knows you sell snow (product aware)
- May need snow (existing demand)

**Copy Approach:**

```
"Fresh snow: 100 Kč per bag. Delivered today."
```

**Why it works:**

- Audience = Product Aware → Most Aware
- Direct pitch appropriate
- No education needed
- Remove friction only

---

### Selling to a Jamaican (Unaware → Problem Aware)

**Context:**

- Never seen snow
- Doesn't know snow exists (unaware)
- Doesn't know they have a "no snow" problem (unaware)
- Lives in heat (potential problem to surface)

**Copy Approach (Multi-Stage):**

**Stage 1: Create Problem Awareness**

```
"Tired of heat making it impossible to preserve food long-term?"
```

→ Jamaican: "Yes, food spoils fast." (now Problem Aware)

**Stage 2: Introduce Solution Category**

```
"Cold storage solutions extend food life 10x.
Three approaches: Ice, refrigeration, or snow."
```

→ Jamaican: "Interesting, what's snow?" (now Solution Aware)

**Stage 3: Educate on Your Solution**

```
"Snow = frozen water from sky (common in cold countries).
Cools 3x longer than ice, costs 50% less than refrigeration."
```

→ Jamaican: "Where can I get snow?" (now Product Aware)

**Stage 4: Pitch Your Product**

```
"We import premium snow from Alaska.
100 Kč per bag. Stays cold 48 hours. Money-back guarantee."
```

→ Jamaican: "I'll try one bag." (now Most Aware → Purchase)

---

### Lesson

**Same product. Radically different copy based on awareness stage.**

**If you use "Eskimo copy" for Jamaican audience:**

- "Fresh snow: 100 Kč"
- Jamaican: "What the hell is snow? Why would I buy this?"
- Result: 0% conversion

**If you use "Jamaican copy" for Eskimo audience:**

- "Tired of heat? Here's what snow is..."
- Eskimo: "I know what snow is, stop wasting my time."
- Result: Annoyance, exit

**Matching awareness stage = foundational to all copy.**

## Cross-References

**Use this framework BEFORE:**

- Writing any copy (see `web-copy/SKILL.md`)
- Designing UVP (see `uvp-optimization/SKILL.md` Phase 1: Position)
- Creating landing pages (see `web-copy` Part B)

**Combine with:**

- `ux-optimization/practices/ab-testing.md` - Test awareness stage hypotheses
- `uvp-optimization/TESTING.md` - Five-second test validates awareness match
- `ux-expert-dialogue` - Expert reviews can identify awareness mismatches

**Diagnosis:**

- If users bounce immediately → Check awareness stage match
- If low conversion despite good UX → Likely wrong awareness targeting
- If testimonials/features don't resonate → Audience may be earlier stage (need education first)
