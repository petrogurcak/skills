### Case Study #6: Čeština 2.0 - Navigation Naming Optimization

- Clear, concrete naming over abstract categories

**Results:**

- "Produkty" and "Naše projekty" performed similarly (both poor)
- Specific naming dramatically outperformed generic naming

**Key Learnings:**

- Users need to know exactly what they'll find
- Context-dependent: works when you have 2-3 distinct items
- May not scale to complex multi-item categories

### Case Study #7: Key4You.cz - Cross-sell in Cart Confirmation

**Client:** key4you.cz (digital game keys e-shop)

- Counter-example: Computer → Out-of-stock accessories ❌

**Key Learnings:**
- Cross-sell in cart confirmation works IF recommendations are relevant

- Don't sacrifice clarity of cart confirmation

### Case Study #10: Customers as Laymen - Design Philosophy

**Client:** Multiple clients (computer e-shop, lighting e-shop, solar panel company)

**Problem:**
- E-shops communicating to experts, not regular customers
- Technical jargon alienating 80%+ of potential buyers
- Customers feeling lost and leaving frustrated

**Key Examples:**

**Example 1: Computer E-shop**
- Problem: Users selecting by "number of cores" without understanding
- One user: "More cores = more Adidas" (equating cores with performance)
- Solution implemented:
  - Added product tags ("Vhodné štítky") for use cases
  - Created clearer category navigation
  - Added contact bar (phone, email, chat, advisor)
- Result: 76% increase in conversion rate

**Example 2: Svítímprotebe.cz (Healthy Lighting)**
- Problem: Too many technical filters (wattage, lumens, kelvin, etc.)
- Customers don't know what they need
- Solution implemented:
  - Added layman-friendly filters higher in hierarchy:
    - "Doba použití" (Usage time)
    - "Vhodnost dle místnosti" (Room suitability)
    - Material, color, style
  - Technical filters moved lower
- Result: Immediate increase in orders after redesign

**Example 3: Solar Panel Installation**
- Problem: Targeting "Enthusiasts" who think they're experts but aren't
- Communication too technical for actual knowledge level
- Solution implemented:
  - Changed messaging: "We'll handle everything turn-key, you have peace of mind"
  - Offered app for monitoring/control (satisfies tinkerer desire)
  - Focused on convenience over technical specs
- Result: Expanded to new customer segments, more leads

**Universal Principles:**
1. 80%+ of customers are laypeople in your category
2. Help them make decisions with:
   - Use-case based filtering
   - Simpler language
   - Proactive assistance (chat, phone, advisors)
   - Trust signals and education

**Key Learnings:**
- Your customers aren't experts in your field (even if they think they are)
- Dunning-Kruger effect is real in e-commerce
- Simplifying ≠ dumbing down, it's helping
- Can serve experts AND laypeople with progressive disclosure
- "Our customers are different" is usually wrong

**Translation:** "What worked for me might not work for you. I repeatedly see one A/B test perform differently across projects. What to do? Test, test, test."

**This aligns perfectly with the UX Optimization skill principle:** Data > opinions. Test in YOUR context.

### Case Study #21: Pricing Psychology - 18 Tips (Dima Melnik)

**Expert:** Dima Melnik (Pricing strategy consultant)

**Proven Results:**
- **Increased premium option acceptance: 11% → 52%** (+373% improvement)
- **85% of clients moved to expensive options** (logistics business)
- **Sold product for 10× higher price** to large portion of clients (SaaS)
- **Middle option adoption: 85%**, cheapest only 10%

**Core Philosophy:**
"One-fit-all" pricing = rejections or underpricing. Maximize acceptance rate through psychological pricing techniques.

**18 Actionable Techniques:**

**1. Segment-Specific Offers ("This was prepared for me")**
- Different buyer segments = different needs
- Museum: $/visitor, Call center: $/operator, Radio: $/minute
- Tailored metrics, packages, and prices per segment
- Result: Personalization increases perceived value

**2. Multiple Paid Options ("More shots = more chances")**
- Single price never optimal (too expensive OR suspiciously cheap)
- Offer 3-4 paid tiers to capture different willingness to pay
- Warning: Free + Paid = only 1 option (not optimal)
- Result: Captures wider customer base

**3. Maximum 4 Packages ("Confused mind doesn't buy")**
- 5+ options = paradox of choice (cognitive overload)
- 4 = max before needing to count
- More segments? Separate offers (Solo vs Firm)
- Result: Reduces decision friction

**4. Default Option Psychology**
- First offer sets benchmark
- $0 first = everything else seems expensive
- Put free/cheapest option BELOW main tiers
- Result: Price-sensitive find it anyway, others anchored higher

**5. Middle Option = Safe Bet**
- People avoid extremes
- Middle = neither cheapest nor most expensive
- **Target KPI: 50-65% choose middle option**
- Result: Predictable revenue, optimal value perception

**6. Substitution Effect (Visual Package Size)**
- Humans substitute simple judgment (# of benefits) for complex (overall value)
- Better product = more checkmarks, larger visual package
- Visual size influences perceived value
- Result: Customers use visual heuristics

**7. Compare Key Features Only**
- Hide common features in detailed table
- Show 3-4 essential common features above packages
- Compare only differentiators
- Example: 6 vs 3 features easier to sell than 33 vs 30
- Result: Simplifies comparison, highlights upgrades

**8. No-Brainer Smart Choice**
- Add small extra value to top tier (+premium support)
- Create LARGE price jump (+200 vs +50)
- Middle becomes obvious "smart choice"
- Result: Drives middle option selection

**9. Seductive Pricing (.9 endings)**
- $199 perceived lower than $200
- Use .9 on options you want to sell (middle + top)
- Cheapest ends in .0 (less attractive)
- **Best result: 85% middle, 10% cheapest**
- Result: +373% proven impact

**10. Start with Highest Price First**
- "Big guns first" sets expensive benchmark
- Other options seem affordable in comparison
- Warning: Don't use if prices vary extremely (€5000 vs €5)
- Result: Anchors perception high

**11. Package Names = Buyer Personas**
- "Broker, Developer, Investor" not "Basic, Pro, Enterprise"
- Cocktail party effect: your name makes you turn around
- "This is ME!" identification
- Result: Instant relevance, self-selection

**12. Make Price Look Tiny (Typography)**
- Large bold: Product name, discount
- Small font: Actual price
- Price seems less important, cheaper
- Result: Reduces price sensitivity

**13. Dream Outcome Summary**
- Single sentence above pricing: "Visitors with excellent experience thanks to..."
- Focus on outcome, not product
- "This is what I dream about"
- Result: Value-focused decision making

**14. Anchor with High Numbers**
- Show large number before prices
- "3,000,000 calls with superior sound" → $399
- Examples: HBO (10,000 entertainment → $14.99), Basecamp (1,562 orgs → $299)
- Result: Prices seem small by comparison

**15. Art of Attention (Visual Highlighting)**
- Highlighted option = most favorable
- Tools: Color, callout badge, discount display
- "Art schools top choice" label
- Result: Directs decision to preferred tier

**16. Minimize Perceived Cost**
- $99/month better than $1,188/year
- Monthly with annual payment (10-20% premium for true monthly)
- Compare to tiny units: $0.50/week, $0.22/day, $0.006/visitor
- Result: Reduces sticker shock

**17. Crown Jewel Clients (Enterprise Tier)**
- Add logos of famous brands to top tier
- Halo effect: Association with quality
- Proves: 1) Can serve enterprise, 2) Others bought it
- Result: Credibility + social proof

**18. Add-Ons at Checkout**
- Small purchases seem valuable after big expense
- Create add-ons from benefits valuable to subset
- Batteries with electronics example
- Separate checkout page or price list
- Result: Increases AOV

**Implementation Metrics:**
- Premium acceptance: 11% → 52% (+373%)
- Middle option selection: Target 50-65%, achieved 85%
- Client migration to expensive options: 85%
- Price realization: 10× for large client portion

**Key Learnings:**
- Pricing is psychology, not just math
- Multiple techniques compound impact
- Test and iterate (not all work everywhere)
- Middle tier = sweet spot for most businesses
- Visual presentation matters as much as actual numbers

**B2B Focus:**
- Particularly effective for B2B SaaS
- Segment-specific offers critical
- Outcome-focused messaging essential
- Social proof (logos) highly valuable
