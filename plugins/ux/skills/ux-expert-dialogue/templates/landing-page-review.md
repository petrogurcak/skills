## DESIGN SPECIFIC TO LANDING PAGES

### Navigation

**Critical decision:** Navigation ON or OFF?

**Expert opinion:**
"Většina high-converting landing pages: NO NAVIGATION (remove distraction)

**Data:**
- No nav: +25% conversion (HighRise/37signals test)
- Each link = exit path
- Exception: High-ticket B2B may need nav (trust building)

**If nav present:**
'Každý menu link je exit path. InfusionSoft odstranili nav = +40.6% conversion. Unless high-ticket B2B product, recommend remove.'"

---

### Length: Short vs Long

**Expert guides:**

**Short-form (above fold only):**
- **When:** Simple product, high-intent traffic, low price point
- **Example:** HOTH +844% with headline + form only
- **Risk:** Low quality leads

**Long-form (scroll required):**
- **When:** Complex product, need trust-building, high price point
- **Example:** Most B2B SaaS, professional services
- **Benefit:** Higher quality leads

**Data:**
- Long-form: +220% information-gathering vs short (CrazyEgg study)
- But: +37% time-on-page requirement

**Challenge:**
"Jaká je average ticket value? <$100 = test short, >$1000 = likely need long."

---

### Visual Hierarchy

**F-Pattern for long landing pages:**
- Hero section spans full width
- Content in F-pattern (left-aligned)
- CTAs break pattern (centered, isolated)

**Z-Pattern for short landing pages:**
- Top-left → top-right (logo → CTA)
- Diagonal to center (hero visual)
- Bottom-right (final CTA)

---

## SUMMARY PHASE

### High-Priority Issues

1. **Message mismatch** (ad promise ≠ landing headline)
   - Impact: Immediate bounce
   - Fix complexity: Low (rewrite headline)
   - Expected gain: +200%+

2. **No/weak social proof**
   - Impact: Trust barrier
   - Fix: Add 3-5 testimonials
   - Expected gain: +60-80%

3. **Generic CTAs**
   - Impact: Low urgency
   - Fix: Specific benefit CTAs
   - Expected gain: +200%+

4. **Navigation present** (if B2C/low-ticket)
   - Impact: Distraction/exits
   - Fix: Remove nav
   - Expected gain: +25-40%

---

**#1 Test: Message Match**
- Control: Current headline
- Variant: Exact ad promise as headline
- Expected: +200%+ if currently mismatched

**#2 Test: CTA Frequency**
- Control: 1-2 CTAs
- Variant: 4-5 CTAs throughout
- Expected: +100-200%

**#3 Test: Navigation**
