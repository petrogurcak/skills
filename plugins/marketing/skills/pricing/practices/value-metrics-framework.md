## Core Concept

> "A value metric is what you charge for — it's your per user, per hundred visits, per thousand widgets, whatever your product is. Even if you get the price point wrong, your value metric will save your entire pricing strategy."
> — Patrick Campbell

**Value metric = How customer pays you + What they pay for**

## Why Value Metrics Matter

### The 7.5x Multiplier

ProfitWell research found:
- **Pricing is 7.5x more powerful** than acquisition for growth
- Yet companies spend **only 10 hours/year** on pricing
- Three growth levers: Acquisition → Retention → **Monetization** (most ignored)

### Value Metric Impact

| Pricing Model | Acquisition | Retention | Monetization |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Flat rate | Low | Low | Low |
| Per seat | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Value metric** | **High** | **High** | **High** |

## Good vs Bad Value Metrics

### Characteristics of Good Value Metrics

1. **Scales with customer success** - As they get more value, they pay more
2. **Easy to understand** - Customer knows what they're paying for
3. **Predictable** - Customer can estimate their bill
4. **Aligns incentives** - You win when customer wins

### Examples

| Product | Bad Metric | Good Metric | Why Better |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Email tool | Per user | Per emails sent | Scales with actual usage |
| Analytics | Flat rate | Per pageviews | Scales with traffic growth |
| CRM | Per feature | Per contacts | Scales with business growth |
| Storage | Per user | Per GB | Pays for what they use |
| Support | Flat rate | Per tickets | Scales with need |

---

## Value Metric Selection Process

### Step 1: List Possible Metrics

Brainstorm all ways customer could pay:
- Per user/seat
- Per usage (API calls, emails, storage)
- Per outcome (leads generated, revenue processed)
- Per feature tier
- Flat rate

### Step 2: Score Each Metric

| Criteria | Weight | Score 1-5 |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Scales with value | 30% | |
| Easy to understand | 25% | |
| Predictable for customer | 25% | |
| Easy to measure/track | 20% | |

### Step 3: Validate with Customers

Ask customers:
- "How would you prefer to pay for this?"
- "What metric best represents the value you get?"
- "Would you pay more if you used more of X?"

## Common Value Metrics by Industry

| Industry | Common Value Metrics |
|----------|---------------------|
| **SaaS B2B** | Per seat, per active user, per contact |
| **Infrastructure** | Per API call, per GB, per compute hour |
| **Marketing** | Per email, per contact, per campaign |
| **E-commerce** | % of GMV, per transaction, per order |
| **Analytics** | Per pageview, per event, per MTU |
| **Communication** | Per message, per minute, per channel |

## Hybrid Models

Best practice: Combine value metric with tiers

```
STARTER          PRO              ENTERPRISE
$29/mo           $99/mo           $299/mo
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Up to 1,000      Up to 10,000     Unlimited
contacts         contacts         contacts
     ↑                ↑                ↑
     └────────── Value Metric ────────┘
```

**Why hybrid works:**
- Tiers provide predictability (customer knows approximate cost)
- Value metric ensures fair pricing as they grow
- Upsell path is automatic (hit limit → upgrade)

## Anti-Patterns

### Per-Seat Trap

❌ **Problem:** Per-seat pricing punishes adoption
- Customer wants whole team to use product
- But adding seats = higher cost
- Results in "seat rationing" and lower adoption

✅ **Solution:** Per-seat with generous minimums, or activity-based metric

### Vanity Metric Trap

❌ **Problem:** Metric doesn't correlate with value
- Charging per "project" when projects vary 100x in size
- Charging per "user" for product used by 1 power user

✅ **Solution:** Find metric that actually scales with value delivered

### Complexity Trap

❌ **Problem:** Multiple metrics confuse customers
- "Per user + per GB + per API call + per integration"
- Customer can't predict their bill

✅ **Solution:** One primary metric, others as add-ons

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] List 5+ possible value metrics for your product
- [ ] Score each metric on 4 criteria
- [ ] Interview 10+ customers about preferred payment model
- [ ] Test top 2 metrics with price sensitivity research
- [ ] Design tier structure around chosen value metric
- [ ] Create clear upgrade path based on metric limits
- [ ] Monitor metric correlation with customer success (NPS, retention)

> "The reason the value metric is so important for acquisition, monetization and retention is because even if you get the price point kind of wrong, your value metric will save your entire pricing strategy."
