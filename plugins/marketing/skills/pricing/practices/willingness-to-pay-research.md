## Core Principle

> "Design the product around the price — not the price around the product."
> — Madhavan Ramanujam

**72% of innovations fail to meet revenue goals** because pricing is an afterthought.

## The 9-Step Monetizing Innovation Framework

### Phase 1: Before Building

```
Step 1: Have the WTP conversation early
Step 2: Don't default to cost-plus or competitor-based
Step 3: Segment by willingness to pay
```

### Phase 2: During Development

```
Step 4: Build configurations around WTP
Step 5: Design products, not features
Step 6: Develop monetization options beyond list price
```

### Phase 3: Go-to-Market

```
Step 7: Build a business case with monetization at the core
Step 8: Communicate value, not features
Step 9: Use behavioral pricing tactics
```

## WTP Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Ask 4 questions:
1. At what price would this be **too expensive** to consider?
2. At what price would this be **so cheap** you'd question quality?
3. At what price does this start to seem **expensive** but still worth considering?
4. At what price does this seem like a **bargain/great buy**?

**Output:** Acceptable price range with optimal price point

```
           Too Cheap    Bargain    Expensive    Too Expensive
                ↓          ↓           ↓              ↓
Price:    $10────────$25─────────$50──────────$75────────$100
                      └─────────────┘
                     Optimal Range: $25-$50
```

### Gabor-Granger Method

Direct approach:
1. Show price, ask "Would you buy at $X?"
2. If yes → increase price, repeat
3. If no → decrease price, repeat
4. Find maximum acceptable price

**Best for:** Simple products, quick validation

### Conjoint Analysis (MaxDiff)

Trade-off analysis:
1. Show multiple product configurations with prices
2. Ask which they'd choose
3. Statistical analysis reveals:
   - Feature importance
   - Price sensitivity
   - Optimal bundles

**Best for:** Complex products, package design

## Sample Size Guidelines

| Method | Minimum Sample | Ideal Sample |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Van Westendorp | 100 | 300+ |
| Gabor-Granger | 50 | 200+ |
| Conjoint | 200 | 500+ |
| Qualitative interviews | 12 | 20-30 |

## Segmentation by WTP

### Why Segment?

Different customers have different WTP:
- Enterprise vs SMB
- Power users vs casual
- Price-sensitive vs value-focused

### Segmentation Approach

| Segment | Characteristics | Pricing Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Price Buyers** | Cost-focused, compare alternatives | Entry tier, clear value |
| **Value Buyers** | ROI-focused, want proof | Middle tier, case studies |
| **Relationship Buyers** | Trust-focused, want partner | Premium tier, services |

## Common WTP Research Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Asking Wrong Questions

❌ "How much would you pay for this?"
- People understate WTP
- Hypothetical ≠ real behavior

✅ "At what price would this be too expensive?"
- Reveals upper bound
- More accurate responses

### Mistake 2: Testing Too Late

❌ WTP research after product built
- Can't change features based on findings
- Price becomes afterthought

✅ WTP research during ideation
- Shape product around WTP
- Build what people will pay for

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Segments

❌ One price for all customers
- Leave money on table with high-WTP customers
- Lose low-WTP customers entirely

✅ Tiered pricing based on WTP segments
- Capture value from each segment
- Maximize total revenue

## Quick WTP Validation (Startup Method)

When you can't do formal research:

### 5-Question Customer Interview

1. "What problem does this solve for you?"
2. "How are you solving it today?" (current spend = anchor)
3. "What would it be worth to solve this perfectly?"
4. "At $X, would this be a no-brainer?" (test high price)
5. "What would make you hesitate at that price?"

### Landing Page Test

1. Create pricing page with 3 tiers
2. Drive traffic (ads, social)
3. Measure click-through on each tier
4. A/B test different price points
5. Validate with actual purchases

## Key Insight

> "72% of new products fail to meet revenue and profit goals. The main reason? They never talked to customers about willingness to pay before building."
