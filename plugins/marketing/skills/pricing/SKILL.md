# Pricing - Dima Melnik Methodology

## Overview

This skill provides a systematic framework for pricing strategy based on Dima Melnik's research and methodologies. It covers two main areas:

1. **Price Offer Design** - How to structure pricing pages and price tables for maximum conversion
2. **Price Increase Strategy** - How to communicate price increases to existing customers without losing them

**Core principle:** Pricing is psychology, not math. Every element on a pricing page influences perception and decision-making.

**Announce:** "I'm using pricing skill to [design pricing page / plan price increase communication]."

---

## When to Use

**USE this skill:**

- Designing or optimizing pricing pages
- Creating price comparison tables
- Planning price increase for existing customers
- Structuring SaaS/subscription tiers
- Writing price increase email sequences
- Auditing pricing presentation

**DON'T use this skill:**

- Product positioning (use UVP skill)
- General copywriting (use copywriting-orchestrator)
- Financial/accounting decisions

## Quick Router

### Step 1: Detect Pricing Task Type

| Keywords in Request                                         | Detected Type      | Go To   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `price increase`, `raise prices`, `zvýšení cen`, `zdražení` | Price Increase     | Phase A |
| `pricing page`, `ceník`, `balíčky`, `tiers`, `packages`     | Price Offer Design | Phase B |
| `price table`, `comparison`, `srovnání cen`                 | Price Offer Design | Phase B |
| `price email`, `announcement`, `oznámení`                   | Price Increase     | Phase A |

### Step 2: If Unclear, Ask

```
I need to know what type of pricing task you're working on:

A) Price Increase - Raising prices for existing customers
B) Price Offer Design - Creating/optimizing pricing page or table
C) Both - Full pricing strategy
```

---

## Phase A: Price Increase Strategy (10 Tactics)

**When:** Raising prices for existing customers

**IMPORTANT: Use TodoWrite to create todos for EACH step.**

### The 10-Step Price Increase Framework

```
1. Game Plan → 2. Personalized Discount → 3. Psychological Borders
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
4. Test First → 5. Migrate in Groups → 6. First Impression
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
7. Calm Down → 8. Value Increase → 9. Social Proof
     ↓
10. Postpone in Time
```

### Step PI-1: Game Plan (Customer Migration Table)

- [ ] Create customer migration table
- [ ] Segment customers by plan/tier
- [ ] Define old price → new price for each segment
- [ ] Calculate % increase per segment

**Migration Table Template:**

| Segment    | Old Price | New Price | % Increase | Migration Date |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Basic      | $29/mo    | $39/mo    | +34%       | Wave 1         |
| Pro        | $99/mo    | $129/mo   | +30%       | Wave 2         |
| Enterprise | Custom    | Custom    | +20%       | Wave 3         |

**Key insight:** Pokud zákazníci měnili tier (např. Basic→Pro), zahrň je do "old tier" kategorie pro nižší šok.

### Step PI-2: Personalized Discount

- [ ] Calculate tenure-based discount
- [ ] Apply "Loyalty Discount" messaging

**Formula:**

```
Loyalty Discount = Years as customer × 5%
Max discount: 25%
```

**Messaging:**

> "Jako zákazník od roku 2021 máte nárok na slevu 15% na novou cenu."

### Step PI-3: Psychological Price Borders

- [ ] Check if new price crosses psychological border
- [ ] Adjust to stay below border if possible

**Borders:** $10, $50, $100, $500, $1000

**Example:**

- ❌ $99 → $110 (crosses $100 border = psychological shock)
- ✅ $99 → $99 (hold price, increase value)
- ✅ $99 → $109 (stays below $110 perceived border)

### Step PI-4: Test with New Customers First

- [ ] Implement new pricing for NEW customers only
- [ ] Monitor conversion rate for 2-4 weeks
- [ ] Adjust if conversion drops significantly

**Why:** New customers don't know old price. Test market acceptance before migrating existing customers.

### Step PI-5: Migrate in Groups

- [ ] Define migration waves (3-5 groups)
- [ ] Start with least risky segment
- [ ] Monitor churn after each wave before proceeding

**Wave Order:**

1. Smallest/newest customers
2. Mid-tier customers
3. Largest/oldest customers (most careful)

### Step PI-6: First Impression (Email Subject Line)

- [ ] Use POSITIVE framing in subject line
- [ ] Avoid "Price Increase" in subject

**Subject Line Examples:**

| ❌ Bad                      | ✅ Good                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Price Increase Notice       | What's New at [Company]               |
| Important Pricing Update    | Your Exclusive Loyalty Reward         |
| Your Plan Price is Changing | Exciting Updates + Your Special Offer |

### Step PI-7: Calm Down (List Improvements)

- [ ] List 5-10 improvements made since last price
- [ ] Use bullet points, easy to scan
- [ ] Lead with most impressive improvement

**Template:**

```
Za poslední rok jsme přidali:
• Feature A - ušetří vám 3 hodiny týdně
• Feature B - 40% rychlejší než předtím
• Feature C - kompletně přepracovaný design
• Feature D - nová integrace s [Popular Tool]
• Feature E - rozšířená podpora
```

### Step PI-8: Value Increase

- [ ] Consider offering MORE value instead of just raising price
- [ ] Bundle new features with price increase

**Options:**

1. **Hold price, add value** - Keep $99, add 2 new features
2. **Raise price, add value** - $129 includes Premium Support
3. **Create new tier** - New "Pro Plus" at $149, keep old tier

### Step PI-9: Social Proof

- [ ] Include customer testimonial about value
- [ ] Show usage stats if impressive

**Examples:**

> "147 firem z Fortune 500 používá náš produkt"
> "Průměrná úspora: 12 hodin/týden"
> "98% zákazníků by nás doporučilo"

### Step PI-10: Postpone in Time

- [ ] Offer delayed implementation (60-90 days)
- [ ] Create urgency for early action

**Messaging:**

> "Nová cena platí od 1. března. Do 31. ledna si můžete předplatit celý rok za starou cenu."

### Tactic PO-1: Segment-Specific Offers

- [ ] Create different offers for different segments
- [ ] Each segment sees most relevant package first

**Example:**

- Freelancers → Solo plan highlighted
- Agencies → Team plan highlighted
- Enterprise → Custom plan highlighted

### Tactic PO-2: Multiple Price Options

- [ ] NEVER offer just one price
- [ ] Minimum 2-3 options

**Why:** Single price = take it or leave it. Multiple options = "which one?" (buying decision already made)

### Tactic PO-3: Max 4 Packages

- [ ] Limit to 3-4 pricing tiers
- [ ] More = decision paralysis

**Optimal:** 3 tiers (Good-Better-Best)

| ❌ Bad           | ✅ Good           |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 6+ packages      | 3 packages        |
| Too many choices | Clear progression |

### Tactic PO-4: Hide Cheap Option

- [ ] De-emphasize cheapest tier visually
- [ ] Smaller box, less prominent position
- [ ] Gray/muted colors

**Goal:** Make cheap option look like "starter" not "real" option.

### Tactic PO-5: Middle Option is Key

- [ ] Target 50-65% of customers choosing middle tier
- [ ] Make middle option visually prominent
- [ ] Best value positioning

**Goldilocks Effect:** Most people avoid extremes.

### Tactic PO-6: Substitution Effect

- [ ] Add "decoy" option to make target look better
- [ ] Decoy should be slightly worse deal than target

**Example:**
| Basic | **Pro (Target)** | Pro+ (Decoy) |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| $29 | **$49** | $59 |
| 10 features | **25 features** | 27 features |

Pro+ adds only 2 features for $10 more → Pro looks like best value.

### Tactic PO-7: Compare Key Features Only

- [ ] Max 5-7 features in comparison table
- [ ] Focus on differentiating features
- [ ] Remove features common to all tiers

**❌ Bad:** 20+ feature comparison (overwhelming)
**✅ Good:** 5-7 KEY differentiators

### Tactic PO-8: No-Brainer Smart Choice

- [ ] Make one option obviously the best deal
- [ ] Use "Most Popular" or "Best Value" badge

**Messaging:**

> "Nejoblíbenější volba"
> "Doporučujeme"
> "Best Value - Save 40%"

### Tactic PO-9: Seductive Pricing

- [ ] Use psychological pricing ($199 vs $200)
- [ ] End in 9 or 7

**Price Points:**

- $9, $19, $29, $49, $99, $199, $499
- NOT $10, $20, $30, $50, $100, $200, $500

### Tactic PO-10: Start with Big Guns

- [ ] Show highest-value features first
- [ ] Lead with most impressive benefit

**Order:**

1. Most impactful feature
2. Second most impactful
3. Basic features last

### Tactic PO-11: Package Names = Buyer Profiles

- [ ] Name packages after target users
- [ ] Customers self-select into "their" tier

**Examples:**
| Generic Names | Profile Names |
|---------------|---------------|
| Basic, Pro, Enterprise | Solo, Team, Agency |
| Starter, Growth, Scale | Freelancer, Studio, Enterprise |

### Tactic PO-12: Small Font for Prices

- [ ] Use smaller font size for price numbers
- [ ] Larger font for features/benefits

**Visual hierarchy:** Benefits > Price

### Tactic PO-13: Dream Outcome Summary

- [ ] Write 1-line summary of what each tier achieves
- [ ] Focus on outcome, not features

**Example:**

- Solo: "For freelancers who want to save 5 hours/week"
- Team: "For growing teams who need collaboration"
- Agency: "For agencies managing 10+ clients"

### Tactic PO-14: Anchor with High Number

- [ ] Show high number before price
- [ ] Creates reference point

**Examples:**

> "Value: $2,400/year → Your price: $499/year"
> "Ušetříte 12 000 Kč ročně"
> "Průměrná úspora: $15,000/year"

### Tactic PO-15: Highlight Preferred Option

- [ ] Use visual emphasis on target tier
- [ ] Larger box, different color, badge

**Techniques:**

- Larger card size
- Different background color
- "Popular" badge
- Slight shadow/elevation

### Tactic PO-16: Minimize Perceived Cost

- [ ] Show monthly price even for annual billing
- [ ] Compare to daily cost of coffee

**Reframing:**

- ❌ "$588/year"
- ✅ "$49/month (billed annually)"
- ✅ "Less than $2/day"
- ✅ "Costs less than your daily coffee"

### Tactic PO-17: Crown Jewel Logos

- [ ] Show most impressive customer logos
- [ ] Place near pricing section

**Selection criteria:**

1. Most recognizable brands
2. Same industry as target customer
3. Aspirational companies

### Tactic PO-18: Add-ons

- [ ] Offer optional add-ons after tier selection
- [ ] Low-cost, high-margin items

**Examples:**

- Priority support (+$29/mo)
- Extra users (+$15/user)
- White-label (+$99/mo)
- Training session (+$199 one-time)

## Core Philosophy: Design Around the Price

> **"Design the product around the price — not the price around the product."**
> — Madhavan Ramanujam, Simon-Kucher

### The Paradigm Shift

| Traditional (72% Fail)              | Successful Innovators               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Design → Build → Market → **Price** | Market → **Price** → Design → Build |
| Price is afterthought               | WTP drives product decisions        |

**Case Study — Porsche Cayenne:** Before development, Porsche researched WTP. Removed features customers didn't value (racing transmission), added what they'd pay for (cup holders). Result: most profitable vehicle in industry history.

**Case Study — Gillette Guard:** Set 15 rupee target price first, then engineered product (reduced parts from 25 to 4). Result: 60% India market share in 2 years.

---

## Key Psychological Principles

### 1. Anchoring & Coherent Arbitrariness

First number seen becomes reference point. People don't have internal "value meter" — perception is arbitrary but coherent once anchored. Random high numbers (even SSN digits) can increase WTP by **up to 346%**.

### 2. Loss Aversion

People fear losing more than they desire gaining. Frame price increases as "keeping what you have."

### 3. Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

Adding slightly inferior option makes target option look better. The Economist experiment: decoy shifted 52 percentage points toward premium.

### 4. Goldilocks Effect (Safe Bet)

Most people avoid extremes and choose middle option. Target: **50-65%** choosing middle tier.

### 5. Price-Quality Heuristic

Higher price = higher perceived quality. Don't price too low.

### 6. Social Proof

"Most Popular" badges and customer logos reduce risk perception.

### 7. The Power of FREE

FREE isn't just a discount — it's an emotional trigger. Hershey's experiment: FREE shifted 42pp from superior Lindt truffle.

### 8. Leaders, Fillers, Killers

- **Leaders:** Features so valuable people pay for them
- **Fillers:** Nice-to-have, don't drive purchase
- **Killers:** Features that kill deal if forced to pay

## Advanced Visual Design Tactics

Beyond basic presentation, these visual techniques have measurable impact:

| Tactic                                    | Mechanism                         | Impact                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Remove currency symbol ($)                | Reduces payment pain              | +5-10% luxury conversion   |
| Remove comma in thousands (1645 vs 1,645) | Fewer syllables = lower perceived | +3-5%                      |
| Smaller price font                        | Visual = psychological size       | +5-8%                      |
| Precise prices for B2B ($39.72)           | Signals calculated value          | +10-15% trust              |
| Round prices for emotional ($40)          | Reduces cognitive friction        | +5-10% impulse             |
| Wide gap between original/sale price      | Larger perceived savings          | +10-15%                    |
| Vertical stacking for cheap products      | Easier mental math                | +8-12% discount perception |

### The Runway Metaphor

> Designing a pricing page is like building a runway for a plane at night.
> The customer is a pilot in fog with no absolute sense of value.
> **Price anchors and decoys** are landing lights on both sides — they don't tell absolute position, but clearly show where to land safely (buy).
