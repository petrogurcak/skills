Peer-reviewed research and controlled experiments backing pricing tactics.

## 1. The Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

### Dan Ariely's Economist Experiment

**Source:** "Predictably Irrational" (2008), Duke University
**Study:** MIT students choosing Economist subscriptions

**Setup:**
| Option | Price |
|--------|-------|
| A) Online only | $59 |
| B) Print only | $125 |
| C) Print + Online | $125 |

**Results:**

| Options Shown | Online Only | Print Only | Print + Online |
|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| A, B, C | 16% | 0% | **84%** |
| A, C only | **68%** | - | 32% |

**Impact:** Decoy (option B) increased premium choice by **52 percentage points** (+163% relative increase)

**Mechanism:** Option B is "asymmetrically dominated" — worse than C in every way but comparable to C, making C look like obvious choice.

### Application

```
BASIC           PRO (Decoy)      PRO PLUS
$29/mo          $49/mo           $59/mo
────────────────────────────────────────
10 features     20 features      25 features
1 user          1 user           5 users
                    ↑
              Makes Pro Plus look like obvious choice
```

## 2. Charm Pricing ($9 Effect)

### MIT & University of Chicago Study

**Source:** Anderson & Simester (2003), Marketing Science
**Study:** Mail-order catalog A/B test with identical dresses

**Results:**

| Price | Units Sold | Revenue |
|-------|------------|---------|
| $34 | 100 (baseline) | $3,400 |
| $39 | **124** | $4,836 |
| $44 | 98 | $4,312 |

**Impact:** $39 outsold both cheaper ($34) and more expensive ($44) options

**Mechanism:**
1. Left-digit anchoring: We read left-to-right, anchor on "3" in $39
2. Sale price heuristic: Prices ending in 9 signal "deal"
3. $39 perceived closer to $30 than $40

### Gumroad Data Validation

Gumroad analyzed millions of transactions:
- Products at $X.99 convert **better** than at $X.00
- Effect strongest at psychological thresholds ($9.99 vs $10)

### Application

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| $10 | $9 |
| $20 | $19 |
| $50 | $49 |
| $100 | $99 |
| $200 | $199 |
| $500 | $497 |
| $1,000 | $997 |

## 3. Choice Overload (Paradox of Choice)

### Columbia & Stanford Jam Study

**Source:** Iyengar & Lepper (2000), Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
**Study:** Grocery store jam tasting booth

**Setup:**
- Condition A: 24 jam varieties displayed
- Condition B: 6 jam varieties displayed

**Results:**

| Metric | 24 Options | 6 Options |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Stopped at booth | 60% | 40% |
| **Purchased** | **3%** | **30%** |

**Impact:** Fewer options = **10x higher conversion**

**Mechanism:** Too many options create:
1. Analysis paralysis
2. Fear of wrong choice
3. Decision deferral (no purchase)

### Application

| Too Many | Just Right |
|----------|------------|
| 6 pricing tiers | 3-4 tiers |
| 20 features compared | 5-7 key differentiators |
| 10 add-ons | 3-4 add-ons |

## 4. Anchoring Effect

### Tversky & Kahneman's Wheel Study

**Source:** Kahneman & Tversky (1974), Science
**Study:** Spin random wheel (10 or 65), then estimate % of African countries in UN

**Results:**

| Wheel Result | Median Estimate |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Landed on 10 | 25% |
| Landed on 65 | 45% |

**Impact:** Completely random number influenced estimates by **20 percentage points**

### Real Estate Anchoring Study

**Source:** Northcraft & Neale (1987)
**Study:** Real estate agents estimating home value

| Listing Price | Agent Estimate |
|---------------|----------------|
| $119,900 | $114,204 |
| $129,900 | $123,209 |
| $139,900 | $127,318 |
| $149,900 | $128,754 |

**Impact:** Higher anchor = higher estimates, even among "expert" agents

### Application

```
Value: $2,400/year        ← High anchor first
Your price: $499/year     ← Actual price feels like deal

"Save $15,000/year"       ← Anchor on savings
"Just $99/month"          ← Price feels small

"Enterprise: $999/mo"     ← Show expensive first
"Pro: $99/mo" (target)    ← Target feels reasonable
"Basic: $29/mo"           ← Cheap option available
```

## 5. Price-Plan Ordering Effect

### ConversionXL Eye-Tracking Study

**Source:** ConversionXL Research (2019)
**Study:** Eye-tracking + conversion measurement on pricing pages

**Setup:** Same 3 plans, different order:
- Order A: Cheap → Mid → Expensive (left to right)
- Order B: Expensive → Mid → Cheap (left to right)

**Results:**

| Plan Order | Premium Selection | Conversion Rate |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Cheap first (left) | 23% | Baseline |
| **Expensive first (left)** | **34%** | **+10%** |

**Mechanism:**
1. We read left-to-right
2. First plan anchors expectations
3. More time spent analyzing left options
4. Expensive-first makes mid-tier feel like "sensible choice"

### Surveygizmo Validation

**Source:** Surveygizmo internal study
**Finding:** When most expensive plan was first AND recommended plan was second, that plan was chosen more often than any other configuration.

### Application

```
ENTERPRISE         PRO (Recommended)      STARTER
$299/mo            $99/mo                 $29/mo
────────────────────────────────────────────────
← Users read this direction
← Anchor high, then show "sensible" choice
```

## 6. Social Proof Effect

### Testimonial Impact Study

**Source:** Nielsen Global Trust in Advertising Report
**Data:** 28,000 respondents across 56 countries

**Results:**

| Trust Level | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| 92% | Recommendations from people they know |
| 70% | Online consumer opinions |
| 47% | Ads on TV |
| 42% | Ads in newspapers |

### Conversion Impact

**Source:** Various CRO studies aggregated

| Element | Conversion Impact |
|---------|-------------------|
| Customer testimonials | +34% |
| Trust badges | +42% |
| Social proof notifications | +98% |
| Customer logos | +20-30% |
| Number of customers ("Join 10,000+") | +15-25% |

### Application

```
"Trusted by 2,300+ companies including:"
[Logo] [Logo] [Logo] [Logo]

"Join 50,000 professionals who..."

★★★★★ "This saved us 12 hours/week"
— Jan Novák, CEO at TechCorp
```
