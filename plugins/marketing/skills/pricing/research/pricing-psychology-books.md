## Core Philosophy: "Design Around the Price"

> **Design the product around the price — not the price around the product.**

### The Paradigm Shift

| Traditional (Failing) | Successful Innovators |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Design → Build → Market → **Price** | Market → **Price** → Design → Build |
| 72% of innovations fail revenue goals | WTP conversation happens FIRST |
| Price is afterthought | Price drives product decisions |

### Case Studies

**Porsche Cayenne:** Before development, Porsche researched what customers wanted and their WTP. This drove the entire design process.

**Gillette Guard (India):** Designed specifically to hit 15 rupee target price. Result: massive market share in India. Product was engineered backwards from the price point.

## 1. Relativity & The Decoy Effect

People don't evaluate things in absolute terms — only in context and comparison.

### The Economist Experiment (Ariely)

| Option | Price | Choice (with decoy) | Choice (without decoy) |
|--------|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Web only | $59 | 16% | 68% |
| Print only (DECOY) | $125 | 0% | - |
| Print + Web | $125 | **84%** | 32% |

**Impact:** Decoy shifted 52 percentage points toward premium option.

### Safe Bet Principle

People avoid extremes and choose the middle option.

**Target:** 50-65% of buyers should choose the middle tier.

---

## 2. Anchoring & Adjustment

The first number encountered becomes the mental yardstick for all subsequent evaluations — even if completely random.

### Social Security Number Experiment

| SSN Last Digits | Average Bid for Same Item |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 00-19 | $8.64 (baseline) |
| 80-99 | **$29.89** (+246%) |

**Mechanism:** Random high number created anchor that increased WTP by up to **346%**.

### Anchoring Applications

```
VALUE: $2,400/year          ← High anchor first
YOUR PRICE: $499/year       ← Feels like a deal

"Join 2,300+ companies"     ← High number near price
"Just $99/month"            ← Price feels smaller

"Save $15,000/year"         ← Anchor on savings magnitude
```

### First Offer in Negotiation

Whoever states the first number creates the strongest anchor that influences all subsequent expectations.

---

## 3. Coherent Arbitrariness

People don't have an internal "value meter" — they can't determine prices in absolute terms. Our perception is **arbitrary**, but once an anchor is set, our subsequent decisions are **coherent** relative to that anchor.

**Implication:** The first price point a customer sees fundamentally shapes their entire value perception. Control the anchor, control the perception.

---

## 4. Psychology of Numbers

### Left-Digit Effect

We read numbers left-to-right and anchor on the first digit.

| Price | Perceived As | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| $2.99 | "Two dollars" | Left digit = 2 |
| $3.00 | "Three dollars" | Left digit = 3 |

The jump from $2.99 → $3.00 feels **psychologically larger** than $2.79 → $2.80.

### Syllable Effect

Prices with fewer syllables when spoken are perceived as lower.

| Written | Spoken | Syllables | Perception |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1,645 | "one thousand six hundred forty-five" | 8 | Higher |
| 1645 | "sixteen forty-five" | 4 | **Lower** |

**Tactic:** Remove commas from large numbers.

### Round vs. Precise Pricing

| Purchase Type | Use | Example |
|---------------|-----|---------|
| **Emotional** (luxury, impulse) | Round numbers | $40, $100 |
| **Rational** (B2B, utilitarian) | Precise numbers | $39.72, $97 |

Precise numbers signal "calculated value" for rational purchases.

---

## 5. Visual Design Tactics

### Font Size

Smaller font for price = psychologically lower perceived price.

**Hierarchy:** Benefits (large) > Price (small)

### Currency Symbol

Removing the $ or currency symbol reduces "pain of paying" for luxury/premium items.

| With Symbol | Without Symbol |
|-------------|----------------|
| $125 | 125 |
| More "transactional" | More "value-focused" |

### Distance Effect

Horizontal distance between original and sale price increases perceived discount.

```
❌ $99 $79           (close together = smaller perceived discount)
✅ $99 ←→→→ $79     (far apart = larger perceived discount)
```

### Vertical vs. Horizontal

Vertical stacking (prices under each other) reduces mental effort when comparing discounts for cheaper products.

---

## 6. The Power of FREE!

FREE isn't just another discount — it's an emotional trigger linked to fear of loss.

### Lindt vs. Hershey's Experiment

| Scenario | Lindt Truffle | Hershey's Kiss |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **A:** Lindt 15¢, Hershey's 1¢ | 73% | 27% |
| **B:** Lindt 14¢, Hershey's FREE | 31% | **69%** |

**Impact:** Dropping Hershey's by just 1¢ (to FREE) caused massive shift from superior product.

**Mechanism:** FREE eliminates fear of loss entirely. People will sacrifice better value to avoid any risk.

---

## 7. Leaders, Fillers, Killers

Strategic feature categorization to maximize profit and avoid "feature shock."

| Type | Definition | Strategy |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Leaders** | Features so valuable people will pay for them | Highlight prominently, price premium |
| **Fillers** | Nice-to-have, don't drive purchase decision | Bundle with leaders, don't price separately |
| **Killers** | Features customers don't want; kill deal if forced to pay | Remove from bundles, offer only as optional |

### Good/Better/Best Structure

Three tiers help customers self-select while avoiding extremes:

| Tier | Purpose | Typical Selection |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Good (Bronze) | Entry point, de-emphasized | 15-25% |
| **Better (Silver)** | Target option, most value | **50-65%** |
| Best (Gold) | Anchor high, premium users | 15-25% |

---

## 8. Price Increase Strategy

### Price Integrity

When sales are slow, companies must resist "knee-jerk repricing" (panic discounting) which destroys brand value.

**Instead:** Design at least 3 non-price measures (added value, better messaging, improved targeting).

### Gradual Discount Removal

Instead of sudden jump to full price after promotion:

```
❌ Promo: $49 → Full price: $99 (sudden shock)
✅ Promo: $49 → $69 → $89 → $99 (gradual steps)
```

### Perceived Fairness

Customers perceive price as unfair if they believe company is increasing profit at their expense without objective reason (cost increase, added value, market conditions).

**Solution:** Always communicate the "why" — improvements, costs, value additions.

---

## The Runway Metaphor

> Designing a pricing page is like **building a runway for a plane at night**.

The customer is a pilot in fog with no absolute sense of height or position (value). **Price anchors and decoys** are like **landing lights** on both sides of the runway.

They don't tell the pilot their absolute position — but they clearly show:
- Where the center is
- Where to land safely (buy)

If the lights are set too wide or confusingly, the pilot won't dare to land and will fly away (abandon cart).

## Quick Reference: Advanced Tactics

| Tactic | Mechanism | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Remove currency symbol | Reduces payment pain | +5-10% luxury conversion |
| Remove comma in thousands | Fewer syllables = lower perceived | +3-5% |
| Smaller price font | Visual = psychological | +5-8% |
| Precise prices for B2B | Signals calculated value | +10-15% trust |
| Round prices for emotional | Reduces friction | +5-10% impulse |
| Vertical price stacking | Easier comparison | +8-12% discount perception |
| Wide price-discount gap | Larger perceived savings | +10-15% |
| FREE as anchor | Eliminates loss fear | Massive behavioral shift |
| Gradual discount removal | Reduces price shock | -30% churn |
