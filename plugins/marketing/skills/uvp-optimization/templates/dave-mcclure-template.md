---

## Step 1: Choose Your ONE Outcome

**List everything your product does:**

- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________

9. _______________________________________________
10. _______________________________________________

**Pattern analysis:**
What did 70%+ mention? **That's your ONE outcome.**

**Your ONE outcome:**
_______________________________________________

---

## Step 2: Choose Your ONE Modifier

**Pick ONE that best describes your competitive advantage:**

### Option 1: SIMPLE
= Reduces complexity

**When to use:**
- Competitors are complicated
- Users are non-technical
- Steep learning curves in your category
- You remove confusion/overwhelm

**Example:** "Mint.com is a simple way to manage money online"

---

### Option 2: FREE
= Price is key differentiator

**When to use:**
- You're freemium model
- Competitors charge upfront
- Budget-conscious audience
- Price is main barrier to adoption

**Example:** "Canva is a free way to create professional designs"

**Warning:** Don't use if you charge later (builds wrong expectation)

---

### Option 3: FAST
= Speed is competitive advantage

**When to use:**
- Current solutions are slow
- Time-sensitive use case
- Speed measurably better (2x, 10x)
- Instant gratification matters

**Example:** "Transfer is a fast way to send large files"

---

### Option 4: EASY
= Lowers effort/friction

**When to use:**
- Competitors have steep learning curve
- No training required for your product
- Removes steps from workflow
- "Just works" is your advantage

**Example:** "Calendly is an easy way to schedule meetings"

---

### Option 5: SAFE
= Security/trust is paramount

**When to use:**
- Handling sensitive data
- Regulated industry (healthcare, finance)
- Trust is main purchase barrier
- Privacy is differentiator

**Example:** "Signal is a safe way to message friends"

---

**Your chosen modifier:**

[ ] Simple  [ ] Free  [ ] Fast  [ ] Easy  [ ] Safe

**Why this modifier?**
_______________________________________________

---

## Step 3: Add Context (Optional)

**Context clarifies WHO or WHERE. Add ONLY if needed for clarity.**

**Common context additions:**
- "online" (vs. offline alternatives)
- "for teams" (vs. individuals)
- "on mobile" (vs. desktop only)
- "at home" (vs. professional/studio)
- "without code" (vs. requires programming)

**Test if you need context:**

**Without context:**
"[Company] is a [modifier] way to [outcome]"

Does this sentence make complete sense?
- If YES → Skip context (keep it shorter)
- If NO → Add context

**Your context (if needed):**
_______________________________________________

---

## Step 4: Combine Into Elevator Pitch

**Formula:**
`[Company] is a [modifier] way to [outcome] [context]`

**Your first draft:**

[Your company name] is a [simple/free/fast/easy/safe] way to [outcome] [context].

**Fill in the blanks:**

_______________ is a _______________ way to _______________  _______________.
(company)          (modifier)              (outcome)         (context)

---

### Word Count Check

**Count the words:** _____ words

**Ideal:** 8-12 words
**Maximum:** 15 words
**If >15:** Remove adjectives, simplify outcome

---

## Step 5: Jargon Elimination

**The grandmother test:** Would your grandmother understand every word?

**Read your pitch. Circle any potential jargon:**

_______________________________________________

**Common jargon words to replace:**

| Jargon | Plain Language |
|--------|---------------|
| Platform | tool, app, website |
| Solution | (describe what it actually does) |
| Leverage | use |
| Optimize | improve, make better |
| Ecosystem | system, tools |
| Streamline | simplify |
| Innovative | new, different |
| Cutting-edge | advanced, latest |

**De-jargoned version:**

_______________________________________________

---

## Step 6: Identify Your Three Key Words

**What are the THREE most important words in your pitch?**

The words that, if remembered, convey the essence:

1. _______________ (usually your modifier: simple/free/fast)
2. _______________ (usually your outcome: manage money/send files)
3. _______________ (usually context or category: online/teams)

**Example (Mint.com):**
1. Simple
2. Money
3. Online

**Memorability test:**
If someone only remembers these three words, can they recall what you do?

---

## Step 7: Readability Check

**Read your pitch out loud three times.**

**Check for:**
- [ ] Natural conversational flow (not forced/stilted)
- [ ] No tongue twisters or awkward phrasing
- [ ] Can say it comfortably in one breath
- [ ] Sounds like something you'd actually say to a friend

**If any box is unchecked, revise for naturalness.**

**Revised version:**

_______________________________________________

---

## Step 8: Memorability Test

**Method:**
1. Tell your pitch to someone once
2. Have them do an unrelated task for 5 minutes
3. Ask them to repeat your pitch back to you

**Test with 5 people:**

| Person | What They Remembered | Accurate? (Y/N) |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | _________________________ | _____ |
| 2 | _________________________ | _____ |
| 3 | _________________________ | _____ |
| 4 | _________________________ | _____ |
| 5 | _________________________ | _____ |

**Success:** 4+/5 can recall the gist
**Needs work:** <3/5 accurate recall

**If low recall:** Make key words more distinctive or simplify further.

---

## Step 9: Expand to Full UVP (Optional)

**Your elevator pitch is your headline. Now expand:**

**Headline (your elevator pitch):**
_______________________________________________

**Subheading (15-25 words, adds specificity):**
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**Example (Mint.com):**
- Headline: "A simple (and free) way to manage money online"
- Subheading: "Track spending, create budgets, and monitor your credit score—all in one place, automatically."

**3-5 Benefits (bullet points):**
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________

## Common Mistakes with Elevator Pitch

**Mistake 1: Too clever/cryptic**
❌ "Dropbox is a magic pocket for your files"
(Cute but unclear—what IS it?)

✅ "Dropbox is an easy way to store and share files"
(Clear category and benefit)

---

**Mistake 2: Using multiple modifiers**
❌ "A simple, fast, easy, and innovative way to..."
(Dilutes message, sounds like marketing fluff)

✅ "A fast way to..."
(Pick ONE, commit to it)

---

**Mistake 3: Vague outcome**
❌ "A simple way to be more productive"
(Productive how? Doing what?)

✅ "A simple way to manage tasks and deadlines"
(Specific action)

---

**Mistake 4: Jargon overload**
❌ "A streamlined platform to optimize workflows and leverage synergies"
(Corporate buzzword bingo)

✅ "An easy way to manage team projects"
(Plain language, clear benefit)

---

**Mistake 5: Too long**
❌ "A comprehensive solution that helps you easily and quickly manage, organize, track, and optimize all of your daily tasks and projects across multiple teams and departments"
(35 words—no one will remember this)

✅ "An easy way to manage team tasks"
(7 words—memorable)

---

## Competitive Positioning with Elevator Pitch

**List your top 3 competitors and their pitches (if you know them):**

| Competitor | Their Pitch | Their Modifier |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. ____________ | _________________________ | __________ |
| 2. ____________ | _________________________ | __________ |
| 3. ____________ | _________________________ | __________ |

**Your modifier should be DIFFERENT from theirs to avoid head-to-head comparison.**

**Example:**
- Competitor 1: "Fast" → You choose "Easy"
- Competitor 2: "Easy" → You choose "Safe"
- Competitor 3: "Free" → You choose "Simple"

---

## When This Framework Works Best

✅ Consumer products (B2C)
✅ Simple, single-purpose tools
✅ Low brand awareness (need memorability)
✅ Conference/networking contexts
✅ Viral/word-of-mouth growth model
✅ Self-explanatory product category

---

## When to Use Different Framework

❌ Complex B2B solution with multiple features
   → Use **Steve Blank XYZ Method** instead

❌ Novel product category no one understands
   → Use **Venture Hack High-Concept** instead

❌ Urgent problem needing emotional urgency
   → Use **David Cowan Pitchcraft** instead

## Real-World Examples to Study

**Great elevator pitches:**
