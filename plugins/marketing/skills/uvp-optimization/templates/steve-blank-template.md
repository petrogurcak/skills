# Steve Blank: XYZ Method Template

**Framework:** `We help [X] do [Y] using [Z]`

**Best for:** Specific target customer with clear job-to-be-done

---

## Step 1: Define X (Target Customer)

**Who SPECIFICALLY are you helping?**

**Too broad (don't use these):**
- ❌ "businesses"
- ❌ "consumers"
- ❌ "people"
- ❌ "everyone"

**Specific enough (use these as models):**
- ✅ "SaaS companies with 10-50 employees"
- ✅ "First-time home buyers in urban areas"
- ✅ "Freelance designers earning $50k-150k/year"
- ✅ "E-commerce brands doing $1-10M annually"

---

### Defining Your X

**Answer these questions:**

**Demographics (if B2C):**
- Age range: _______________
- Income level: _______________
- Location: _______________
- Life stage: _______________

**Firmographics (if B2B):**
- Company size: _______________
- Industry: _______________
- Revenue range: _______________
- Role/title: _______________

**Psychographics (both):**
- What do they value most? _______________
- What do they fear? _______________
- How tech-savvy are they? _______________

---

### Customer Interview Validation

**Ask 10 current customers: "What do you tell people you do for work?"**

Record their EXACT words:
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________
6. _______________________________________________
7. _______________________________________________
8. _______________________________________________
9. _______________________________________________
10. _______________________________________________

**Use THEIR language for X, not your assumptions.**

---

### Your X:

We help **_______________________________________________**

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Specific enough that competitors serve different X
- [ ] Large enough market to build business
- [ ] You can reach this audience efficiently
- [ ] They have budget/authority to buy

---

## Step 2: Define Y (Job to be Done)

**What outcome are they trying to achieve?**

**Jobs-to-be-Done Framework:**

### Functional Job (what task?)
What are they trying to accomplish?

Examples:
- "Respond to customer support tickets faster"
- "Find qualified leads in their industry"
- "Track project progress across teams"
- "Learn new programming languages"

**Your functional job:**
_______________________________________________

---

### Emotional Job (how do they want to feel?)
What emotion are they seeking or avoiding?

Examples:
- "Feel confident they won't miss deadlines"
- "Reduce stress about data security"
- "Feel professional in client presentations"
- "Avoid embarrassment from grammar mistakes"

**Your emotional job:**
_______________________________________________

---

### Social Job (how do they want to be perceived?)
How do they want others to see them?

Examples:
- "Be seen as organized and reliable"
- "Appear technically sophisticated"
- "Look like they're managing growth well"
- "Seem environmentally conscious"

**Your social job:**
_______________________________________________

---

### Pick ONE for Your Y

**Which job is PRIMARY for your customers?**

Most important: _______________________________________________

**Validation: Ask 10 customers "What were you hoping to accomplish when you signed up?"**

Record answers:
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________
6. _______________________________________________
7. _______________________________________________
8. _______________________________________________
9. _______________________________________________
10. _______________________________________________

**Pattern:** What did 70%+ mention? That's your Y.

---

### Make Y Specific

**Too vague:**
- ❌ "be more productive"
- ❌ "grow their business"
- ❌ "save time"
- ❌ "make money"

**Specific outcomes:**
- ✅ "reduce support ticket response time from 24 hours to 2 hours"
- ✅ "increase qualified leads by 30%"
- ✅ "cut invoice payment time from 45 days to 15 days"
- ✅ "ship features 2x faster without adding engineers"

**Your specific Y:**

_______________________________________________

**Can you quantify it? (2x faster, 30% more, save 10 hours/week)**

Quantified version: _______________________________________________

---

## Step 3: Define Z (Unique Mechanism)

**HOW do you deliver Y differently than competitors?**

**Not unique enough:**
- ❌ "using software"
- ❌ "with our platform"
- ❌ "through our service"
- ❌ "with our app"

**Differentiated mechanisms:**
- ✅ "using AI trained on 10M support conversations"
- ✅ "with no-code workflow automation"
- ✅ "through peer-reviewed expert matching"
- ✅ "with async video standups instead of meetings"

---

### Finding Your Z

**Answer these questions:**

**What's your unfair advantage?**
(Data, technology, network, expertise, process)

_______________________________________________

**How do you deliver Y differently than competitors?**

_______________________________________________

**What can you do that they can't?**

_______________________________________________

**What's your unique insight about solving this problem?**

_______________________________________________

---

### Competitive Differentiation Map

**List your top 3 competitors and their mechanisms:**

| Competitor | How They Deliver Y |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1. ____________ | ________________________________ |
| 2. ____________ | ________________________________ |
| 3. ____________ | ________________________________ |

**Your mechanism must be DIFFERENT from all of these.**

**Your Z:**

using/with/through _______________________________________________

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Competitors can't easily copy this
- [ ] It's a genuine advantage (not just marketing)
- [ ] Customers care about this difference
- [ ] You can explain it simply (no jargon)

---

## Step 4: Combine into UVP Statement

**Formula:** We help [X] do [Y] using [Z]

**Your first draft:**

We help _______________________________________________
        (X - specific customer)

do _______________________________________________
   (Y - outcome/job to be done)

using _______________________________________________
      (Z - unique mechanism)

**Full sentence:**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

### Simplification Test

**Read your draft out loud. Can you say it in one breath?**

If NO, simplify:

**Simplification tactics:**
1. Remove unnecessary words ("in order to" → "to")
2. Use active voice ("is helped by us" → "we help")
3. Cut adjectives ("very powerful AI" → "AI")
4. Shorten Z if it's too technical

**Simplified version:**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

## Step 5: Expand to Complete UVP

**Headline (derived from your XYZ statement):**

Option 1: Lead with X
"For [X]: [Y] using [Z]"

Option 2: Lead with Y
"[Y] using [Z] (for [X])"

Option 3: Lead with Z
"[Z] that helps [X] [Y]"

**Test all three variations:**

Variation A: _______________________________________________
Variation B: _______________________________________________
Variation C: _______________________________________________

**Which feels most natural? Circle one.**

---

**Subheading (15-25 words):**

Expand on HOW it works or WHY it matters

**Your subheading:**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

**3-5 Key Benefits (bullet points):**

What specific advantages does your Z provide?

- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________

---

## Step 6: Customer Language Audit

**Jargon check:** Would your grandmother understand your UVP?

**Read your UVP. Circle any word that might be jargon:**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**Jargon words to replace:**
- Platform → tool, app, software
- Leverage → use
- Optimize → improve
- Solution → (describe what it actually does)
- Ecosystem → system, tools
- Streamline → simplify, speed up

**De-jargoned version:**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

## Step 7: Test with Real Customers

**Five-second test (10 people):**

Show your UVP for 5 seconds, then ask:
1. "What does this company do?"
2. "Who is it for?"
3. "How is it different?"

**Record answers:**

| Person | What? | Who? | How different? |
|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| 1 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 2 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 3 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 4 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 5 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 6 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 7 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 8 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 9 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |
| 10 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ |

**Analysis:**
- 8+/10 understood X, Y, and Z → **SUCCESS**
- 6-7/10 understood → **Needs clarity work**
- <6/10 understood → **Rewrite required**

## Common Mistakes with XYZ Method

**Mistake 1: X is too broad**
❌ "We help businesses grow using automation"
(Every business? All growth? Too vague.)

✅ "We help e-commerce brands increase repeat purchases using AI-powered email"
(Specific industry, specific outcome, specific mechanism)

---

**Mistake 2: Y is features, not outcome**
❌ "We help marketers send emails using our platform"
(Sending emails is feature, not outcome)

✅ "We help marketers increase open rates by 40% using personalized send-time optimization"
(Outcome = higher open rates)

---

**Mistake 3: Z is not differentiated**
❌ "We help designers create graphics using software"
(Everyone uses software)

✅ "We help designers create graphics using AI that learns their style"
(AI + learns style = differentiated)

---

**Mistake 4: Too long/complex**
❌ "We help small-to-medium-sized B2B SaaS companies in North America that are experiencing rapid growth and need to scale their customer support operations reduce response times while maintaining quality using our AI-powered helpdesk software with integrated knowledge base and automated ticket routing"

✅ "We help growing SaaS companies respond to support tickets 10x faster using AI"

---

## When This Framework Works Best

✅ You have clearly defined target customer
✅ You solve specific job-to-be-done
✅ Your mechanism/approach is unique
✅ B2B or professional services contexts
✅ Audience values substance over style

---

## When to Use Different Framework

❌ Your product is similar to known product
   → Use **Venture Hack High-Concept** instead

❌ Problem is urgent/painful (health, security)
   → Use **David Cowan Pitchcraft** instead

❌ Consumer product needing memorability
   → Use **Dave McClure Elevator Pitch** instead

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete all sections of this template
2. De-jargon your language
3. Test with five-second test (10 people minimum)
4. If 80%+ clarity, proceed to A/B testing
5. If <80%, refine X, Y, or Z based on feedback
