# Venture Hack: High-Concept Pitch Template

**Framework:** `[Existing product], but for [new industry/audience]`

**Best for:** Entering established category with new twist

---

## Step 1: Identify Reference Point

**What well-known product/service does yours resemble?**

Examples: Airbnb, Uber, Shopify, Stripe, Salesforce, Netflix, Spotify

Your answer: _______________________________________________

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Your target audience knows this product well
- [ ] This product occupies clear category position
- [ ] This product is not controversial or declining
- [ ] The core functionality is similar to yours

**If you can't check all boxes, this framework isn't right for you.**

---

## Step 2: Define Your Differentiation

**How do you differ from the reference product?**

Check ONE (picking multiple dilutes message):

### Option A: New Industry
- [ ] Same product, different industry vertical

**Example template:**
"[Reference], but for [specific industry]"

**Your version:**
_______________, but for _______________

**Examples:**
- "Stripe, but for healthcare payments"
- "Salesforce, but for nonprofits"
- "Shopify, but for B2B wholesale"

---

### Option B: New Audience
- [ ] Same product, different customer type

**Example template:**
"[Reference], but for [specific customer type]"

**Your version:**
_______________, but for _______________

**Examples:**
- "QuickBooks, but for freelancers"
- "LinkedIn, but for blue-collar workers"
- "Figma, but for non-designers"

---

### Option C: New Use Case
- [ ] Same core technology, different application

**Example template:**
"[Reference], but for [different use case]"

**Your version:**
_______________, but for _______________

**Examples:**
- "Zoom, but for async video messages"
- "Notion, but for personal journaling"
- "Calendly, but for resource booking"

---

### Option D: New Geography
- [ ] Localized version for specific market

**Your version:**
_______________, but for _______________

**Examples:**
- "Uber, but for Lagos"
- "DoorDash, but for Southeast Asia"
- "Venmo, but for Latin America"

---

## Step 3: Combine & Simplify

**Your high-concept pitch:**

_______________, but for _______________

**Read it out loud. Does it:**
- [ ] Communicate category immediately?
- [ ] Clarify differentiation instantly?
- [ ] Spark curiosity (not confusion)?
- [ ] Take <3 seconds to understand?

**If you checked all boxes, proceed to testing.**
**If not, refine reference or differentiation.**

---

## Step 4: Expand to Full UVP

**The high-concept pitch is your foundation. Now build on it:**

**Headline (8-12 words):**
[High-concept pitch] → expanded with benefit

**Example:**
- Pitch: "Airbnb, but for cars"
- Headline: "Rent cars from people nearby—like Airbnb for vehicles"

**Your headline:**
_______________________________________________

---

**Subheading (15-25 words):**
Clarify HOW it works and WHO it's for

**Example:**
- "Skip the rental counter. Borrow cars from trusted locals for less, whether you need it for an hour or a month."

**Your subheading:**
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

**3-5 Bullet Points (key benefits):**

Why someone should use this instead of [reference product]:

- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________
- [ ] _______________________________________________

---

## Step 5: Test Clarity

**Five-second test:**

Show your UVP to 10 people for 5 seconds, then ask:
"What does this company do?"

**Record answers:**
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________
6. _______________________________________________
7. _______________________________________________
8. _______________________________________________
9. _______________________________________________
10. _______________________________________________

**Analysis:**
- How many mentioned the reference product? _____/10
- How many understood the differentiation? _____/10
- How many were confused? _____/10

**Success:** 8+/10 understood both category and differentiation
**Needs work:** <6/10 understood

## Common Mistakes with This Framework

**Mistake 1: Reference is too obscure**
❌ "Like FitBod, but for meal planning"
(Most people don't know FitBod)

✅ "Like MyFitnessPal, but for meal planning"
(Everyone knows MyFitnessPal)

---

**Mistake 2: Differentiation is too vague**
❌ "Uber, but better"
(Better how?)

✅ "Uber, but for scheduled rides only"
(Clear differentiation)

---

**Mistake 3: Reference doesn't match your category**
❌ "Google, but for intranets"
(Google is too broad—search? docs? email?)

✅ "Slack, but for large enterprises"
(Slack clearly = team chat)

---

**Mistake 4: Fighting your reference**
❌ "Uber, but ethical"
(Implies Uber is unethical, alienates existing users)

✅ "Uber, with drivers keeping 100% of fare"
(Positive differentiation, no attacks)

---

## When This Framework Works Best

✅ Your product is genuinely similar to reference
✅ Target audience uses the reference product
✅ You're competing on audience/geography, not features
✅ You need quick comprehension (pitches, ads)

---

## When to Use a Different Framework

❌ Your product is novel (no good reference)
   → Use **Steve Blank XYZ Method** instead

❌ You're solving urgent problem
   → Use **David Cowan Pitchcraft** instead

❌ Reference product is controversial
   → Use **Dave McClure Elevator Pitch** instead

## Next Steps

1. Complete this template
2. Test with five-second test
3. If 80%+ clarity, proceed to A/B testing
4. If <80% clarity, try different reference or framework
