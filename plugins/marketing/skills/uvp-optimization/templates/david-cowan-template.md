# David Cowan: Pitchcraft Template

**Framework:** Problem → Solution → Differentiation → Credibility

**Best for:** Urgent problems, high-stakes contexts, B2B sales, trust-sensitive industries

---

## Part 1: Highlight the Problem

**Goal:** Make the pain visceral and urgent

---

### Step 1.1: Identify the Core Problem

**What bad thing happens to your customers?**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**Is this problem:**
- [ ] Costing them money?
- [ ] Costing them time?
- [ ] Risking their health/safety?
- [ ] Threatening their reputation?
- [ ] Causing stress/anxiety?
- [ ] Preventing growth/success?

**Check all that apply.** The more boxes checked, the stronger the problem.

---

### Step 1.2: Quantify the Stakes

**Make the problem CONCRETE with numbers:**

**Options:**
- Cost: "$_____ lost per year"
- Time: "_____ hours wasted per week"
- Risk: "_____% chance of [bad outcome]"
- Scale: "Affects _____ million people"
- Frequency: "Happens _____ times per day"

**Your quantified problem:**

_______________________________________________

**Example:**
"43% of e-commerce carts are abandoned at checkout, costing retailers $18 billion annually."

---

### Step 1.3: Identify Current Approach (Why It Fails)

**How do people currently try to solve this problem?**

_______________________________________________

**Why does it fail?**
- [ ] Too slow
- [ ] Too expensive
- [ ] Too complicated
- [ ] Not accurate enough
- [ ] Doesn't scale
- [ ] Requires expertise they don't have

**Your statement:**

"Traditional [approach] fails because _______________________________________________."

---

### Step 1.4: Combine into Problem Statement

**Formula:**
```
[Bad thing] happens because [current situation].
This causes [negative outcome with numbers].
```

**Your problem statement (2-3 sentences max):**

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

### Problem Statement Checklist

Does your problem statement:
- [ ] Trigger recognition ("Yes, I experience this!")?
- [ ] Include specific numbers (cost, time, frequency)?
- [ ] Explain why current approaches fail?
- [ ] Create urgency (not just inconvenience)?

**If all checked → proceed. If not → make more specific.**

---

## Part 2: Offer Your Solution

**Goal:** Position your solution as direct answer to stated problem

---

### Step 2.1: Action Verb Selection

**Choose the verb that best describes what you do:**

**For problems (negative things):**
- [ ] Eliminate
- [ ] Prevent
- [ ] Reduce
- [ ] Stop
- [ ] Protect against
- [ ] Detect

**For opportunities (positive things):**
- [ ] Increase
- [ ] Accelerate
- [ ] Improve
- [ ] Enable
- [ ] Unlock
- [ ] Automate

**Your verb:** _______________

---

### Step 2.2: Describe the Solution Method

**Formula:**
```
We [action verb] [the problem] by [method/mechanism].
```

**Your solution (1 sentence):**

We _______________________________________________
   (action verb)

_______________________________________________
(the problem from Part 1)

by/using/through _______________________________________________
                  (your method/mechanism)

---

### Step 2.3: Bridge Test

**Does your solution DIRECTLY address the problem you stated?**

**Example of GOOD bridge:**
- Problem: "Melanoma kills 10,000 people/year due to late detection"
- Solution: "We detect melanoma risk early using smartphone camera AI"
✅ Direct connection

**Example of POOR bridge:**
- Problem: "Support teams drown in repetitive tickets"
- Solution: "We offer comprehensive support platform"
❌ Vague, doesn't directly address "repetitive" or "drowning"

**Your bridge quality:**
[ ] Direct connection
[ ] Partial connection (revise)
[ ] Weak connection (rewrite)

**If weak, revise your solution to more directly address the problem.**

---

## Part 3: One-Sentence Differentiation

**Goal:** Answer "Why you, not competitors?"

---

### Step 3.1: Map Competitor Approaches

**List top 3 competitors and how THEY solve the problem:**

| Competitor | Their Approach | Limitation |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| 1. ____________ | _______________________ | _________________ |
| 2. ____________ | _______________________ | _________________ |
| 3. ____________ | _______________________ | _________________ |

---

### Step 3.2: Identify Your Unique Advantage

**What can you do that they can't?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Proprietary data/dataset they don't have
- [ ] Unique technology or algorithm
- [ ] Specific expertise/credentials
- [ ] Network effects or partnerships
- [ ] Regulatory approvals (FDA, SOC2, etc.)
- [ ] Speed advantage (10x faster)
- [ ] Integration advantage (works with X)
- [ ] Customization (learns from YOUR data specifically)

**Your unfair advantage:**

_______________________________________________

---

### Step 3.3: Formulate Differentiation Statement

**Two formula options:**

**Formula 1: Negative comparison**
```
Unlike [competitors/alternative], we [unique advantage].
```

**Formula 2: Exclusive claim**
```
We're the only [category] that [unique capability].
```

---

**Option 1 - Your negative comparison:**

Unlike _______________________________________________,
       (competitors/generic alternative)

we _______________________________________________
   (unique advantage)

**Example:** "Unlike generic chatbots, we're trained on YOUR company's data specifically."

---

**Option 2 - Your exclusive claim:**

We're the only _______________________________________________
                (category/product type)

that _______________________________________________
     (unique capability)

**Example:** "We're the only platform that integrates directly with all major EMR systems."

---

**Choose the formula that feels stronger. Circle one:**

[ ] Option 1 (Unlike...)
[ ] Option 2 (Only...)

**Your differentiation statement:**

_______________________________________________

---

### Differentiation Checklist

- [ ] Is this claim factually true?
- [ ] Can competitors easily copy this?
- [ ] Do customers care about this difference?
- [ ] Can you prove this claim?

**If you checked <3 boxes, your differentiation is weak. Find stronger angle.**

---

## Part 4: Boost Credibility

**Goal:** Overcome skepticism with proof

---

### Step 4.1: Identify Main Objection

**What's the biggest reason someone wouldn't believe you?**

Check one (the PRIMARY objection):
- [ ] "How do I know it actually works?"
- [ ] "Is this legitimate/safe?"
- [ ] "Can you handle my scale/complexity?"
- [ ] "Do I trust you with sensitive data?"
- [ ] "Are you going to be around in 5 years?"
- [ ] "Is this just marketing hype?"

**Your primary objection:**

_______________________________________________

---

**For "Is team capable?" → Expert Team Proof**
- "Founded by ex-[Google/Amazon] engineers"
- "Team of PhDs from [Stanford/MIT]"
- "20+ years combined experience in [domain]"

---

### Step 4.3: Select Your Strongest Proof

## Part 6: Test Your Pitchcraft UVP

### Clarity Test (10 people)

Show your UVP, then ask:
1. "What problem does this solve?"
2. "How is this different from alternatives?"
3. "Why should I trust this?"

**Record responses:**

| Person | Problem? | Different how? | Trust why? |
|--------|----------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 2 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 3 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 4 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 5 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 6 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 7 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 8 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 9 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |
| 10 | ____________ | ______________ | ____________ |

**Success:** 8+/10 can accurately explain all three
**Needs work:** <7/10 understanding

---

### Urgency Test

**Ask 5 people:** "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent does this problem seem?"

| Person | Urgency (1-10) | Why? |
|--------|---------------|------|
| 1 | _____ | ___________________________ |
| 2 | _____ | ___________________________ |
| 3 | _____ | ___________________________ |
| 4 | _____ | ___________________________ |
| 5 | _____ | ___________________________ |

**Average:** _____ / 10

**If <6/10:** Problem isn't urgent enough. Add more stakes/consequences.

---

## Common Mistakes with Pitchcraft

**Mistake 1: Problem is too vague**
❌ "Businesses struggle with productivity"
(Every business? What kind of struggle?)

✅ "Support teams spend 60% of time on repetitive questions, causing 24-hour response delays and agent burnout"
(Specific problem, quantified impact)

---

**Mistake 2: Solution doesn't match problem**
❌ Problem: "Data breaches cost $4M on average"
   Solution: "We offer comprehensive security platform"
(Vague solution to specific problem)

✅ Problem: "Data breaches cost $4M on average"
   Solution: "We prevent breaches by detecting insider threats in real-time"
(Direct solution to stated problem)

---

**Mistake 3: Differentiation is opinion**
❌ "We're the best platform for X"
(Says who?)

✅ "We're the only platform with ISO 27001 + SOC 2 + HIPAA compliance"
(Factual, verifiable)

---

**Mistake 4: Credibility is weak**
❌ "We're passionate about security"
(Emotion, not proof)

✅ "We've prevented 10,000+ breaches across 500 companies"
(Data, proof of delivery)

---

## When This Framework Works Best

✅ Problem is urgent/painful
✅ High-stakes contexts (health, security, finance)
✅ Multiple competitors exist (need differentiation)
✅ Trust is barrier to purchase
✅ B2B sales contexts
✅ Regulated industries

---

## When to Use Different Framework

❌ Simple consumer product, no urgent problem
   → Use **Dave McClure Elevator Pitch** instead

❌ Your product is twist on known product
   → Use **Venture Hack High-Concept** instead

❌ Problem isn't urgent, but solution is elegant
   → Use **Steve Blank XYZ Method** instead

---

## Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Health Tech**
- Problem: "Melanoma kills 10,000 people/year. Early detection is critical but dermatologist wait times are 6+ weeks."
- Solution: "We detect melanoma risk instantly using your smartphone camera."
- Differentiation: "We're the only FDA-cleared AI using WHO-approved dermatology standards."
- Credibility: "Validated in clinical trials with 95% accuracy across 50,000 scans."

**Example 2: Cybersecurity**
- Problem: "70% of antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily, driving antibiotic resistance."
- Solution: "We prevent unnecessary prescriptions using rapid diagnostic tests."
- Differentiation: "Unlike standard culture tests that take 48 hours, we deliver results in 15 minutes."
- Credibility: "Used by 200+ clinics, reducing unnecessary prescriptions by 60%."
