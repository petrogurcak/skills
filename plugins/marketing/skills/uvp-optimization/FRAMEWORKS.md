# UVP Formulation Frameworks

**Purpose:** Transform your positioning into a clear, compelling statement.

**Critical Rules:**
1. Research BEFORE writing (see SKILL.md Phase 2.1)
2. Talk like your customers do, not like marketers
3. Test multiple variations (50+ headlines recommended)
4. Clarity beats cleverness

---

## Framework 1: Venture Hack - High-Concept Pitch

**Origin:** Venture capitalist pitch methodology adapted for customer-facing UVP

**Structure:**
```
[Existing well-known product/service], but for [new industry/audience/use case]
```

**Why it works:**
- Anchors to familiar reference point (reduces cognitive load)
- Instantly communicates category and differentiation
- Memorable and shareable
- Forces focus on ONE key difference

---

### When to use:
- Entering established category with new twist
- Target audience knows reference product well
- Your differentiation is audience/industry, not core functionality
- You need elevator pitch clarity

---

### Examples:

**Good:**
- "Airbnb, but for cars" (Turo)
- "Uber, but for private jets" (JetSmarter)
- "Shopify, but for creators" (Gumroad)
- "Stripe, but for embedded finance" (Unit)

**Bad:**
- "Facebook, but better" → No clear differentiation
- "Google, but for intranets" → Reference too broad
- "Salesforce, but for small business" → Vague audience

---

### Step-by-step:

**1. Identify reference point**
   - Must be widely known by target audience
   - Should occupy clear category position
   - Avoid controversial or declining brands

**2. Define differentiation**
   - New industry (Airbnb for cars)
   - New audience (Salesforce for nonprofits)
   - New use case (Figma for presentations)
   - New geography (Uber for Lagos)

**3. Test clarity**
   - Does target audience know reference product?
   - Is differentiation immediately obvious?
   - Does it spark curiosity vs. confusion?

**4. Validate**
   - Five-second test: "What do we do?"
   - If they can't explain it, reference is wrong

## Framework 2: Steve Blank - XYZ Method

**Origin:** Customer development methodology founder Steve Blank

**Structure:**
```
We help [X] do [Y] using [Z]

Where:
X = Specific target customer
Y = Job to be done / outcome achieved
Z = Unique mechanism or approach
```

**Why it works:**
- Forces specificity (no vague "everyone" positioning)
- Outcome-focused (customers buy results, not features)
- Differentiates via mechanism (how you deliver)
- Action-oriented language

---

### When to use:
- You have clearly defined target customer
- You solve specific problem or job-to-be-done
- Your methodology/approach is unique
- B2B or professional services contexts

---

### Examples:

**Good:**
- "We help tourists rent cars abroad affordably" (clear X, Y, Z implied)
- "We help e-commerce brands increase repeat purchases using AI-powered email personalization"
- "We help freelancers get paid on time using automated invoicing and payment reminders"
- "We help remote teams stay aligned using async video standups"

**Bad:**
- "We help everyone be successful" → No specificity
- "We help businesses grow" → Vague outcome
- "We help marketers using software" → Generic mechanism

---

### Step-by-step:

**1. Define X (Target Customer)**

**Too broad:**
- "businesses"
- "consumers"
- "people"

**Specific enough:**
- "SaaS companies with 10-50 employees"
- "First-time home buyers in urban areas"
- "Freelance designers earning $50k-150k/year"

**Customer interview question:**
"What do you tell people you do for work?"
Use THEIR language for X.

---

**2. Define Y (Job to be Done)**

**Framework: Jobs-to-be-Done**
- Functional job: What task are they trying to complete?
- Emotional job: How do they want to feel?
- Social job: How do they want to be perceived?

**Too vague:**
- "be more productive"
- "grow their business"
- "save time"

**Specific outcomes:**
- "reduce support ticket response time from 24 hours to 2 hours"
- "increase qualified leads by 30%"
- "cut invoice payment time from 45 days to 15 days"

**Customer interview question:**
"What were you hoping to accomplish when you signed up?"

---

**3. Define Z (Unique Mechanism)**

**Not unique enough:**
- "using software"
- "with our platform"
- "through our service"

**Differentiated mechanisms:**
- "using AI trained on 10M support conversations"
- "with no-code workflow automation"
- "through peer-reviewed expert matching"

**Ask yourself:**
- How do we deliver Y differently than competitors?
- What's our unfair advantage in methodology?

---

**4. Combine and simplify**

**First draft (often too long):**
"We help SaaS companies with 10-50 employees reduce support ticket response time from 24 hours to 2 hours using AI trained on 10M support conversations that automatically suggests responses."

**Simplified:**
"We help small SaaS teams respond to support tickets 10x faster using AI-powered response suggestions."

**Rule:** If you can't say it in one breath, it's too long.

---

**5. Test variations**

Try different emphasis:
- Lead with customer: "For small SaaS teams: Respond to support tickets 10x faster..."
- Lead with outcome: "Respond to support tickets 10x faster (even with small teams)..."
- Lead with mechanism: "AI-powered support that helps small SaaS teams respond 10x faster..."

**A/B test to find winner.**

## Framework 3: Dave McClure - Elevator Pitch

**Origin:** 500 Startups founder Dave McClure's pitch methodology

**Structure:**
```
[Company] is a [simple/free/fast] way to [outcome] [context]

Requirements:
- Short (one sentence, <15 words ideal)
- Simple (no jargon, 8th-grade reading level)
- Memorable (three key words maximum)
```

**Why it works:**
- Extreme clarity through constraint
- Easy to remember and repeat
- Forces prioritization (can't include everything)
- Natural conversational tone

---

### When to use:
- Consumer products (B2C)
- Simple, single-purpose tools
- When brand awareness is low (need memorability)
- Conference/networking contexts

---

### Examples:

**Good:**
- "Mint.com is a simple (and free) way to manage money online"
  - Key words: simple, free, money
- "Dropbox is an easy way to store and share files"
  - Key words: easy, store, share
- "Calendly is a simple way to schedule meetings"
  - Key words: simple, schedule, meetings

**Bad:**
- "We leverage cutting-edge AI to optimize your workflow" → Jargon
- "The world's most advanced platform for..." → Not simple
- "Revolutionizing how enterprises..." → Too complex

---

### Step-by-step:

**1. Choose ONE outcome**

List everything your product does:
- ☐ Manages finances
- ☐ Tracks spending
- ☐ Creates budgets
- ☐ Sends bill reminders
- ☐ Monitors credit score
- ☐ Suggests savings

**Pick the #1 thing:** "Manage money"

**How to choose:**
Ask 10 customers: "What's the main reason you use us?"
Majority answer = your ONE outcome.

---

**2. Choose ONE modifier (simple/free/fast/easy/safe)**

**Simple** = Reduces complexity
- Use when: Competitors are complicated, users are non-technical

**Free** = Price is key differentiator
- Use when: You're freemium, competitors charge upfront

**Fast** = Speed is competitive advantage
- Use when: Current solutions are slow, time-sensitive use case

**Easy** = Lowers effort/friction
- Use when: Competitors have steep learning curve

**Safe** = Security/trust is paramount
- Use when: Handling sensitive data, regulated industry

**Mint.com chose "simple" and "free"** because competitors (Quicken) were complicated and expensive.

---

**3. Add context (optional, max 3 words)**

Context clarifies WHO or WHERE:
- "...online" (vs. offline alternatives)
- "...for teams" (vs. individuals)
- "...on mobile" (vs. desktop)

**Only add if necessary for clarity.**

---

**4. Remove all jargon**

**Jargon test:** Would your grandmother understand?

**Jargon words to avoid:**
- Platform, solution, ecosystem
- Leverage, optimize, streamline
- Revolutionary, cutting-edge, next-generation
- Synergy, paradigm, disruptive

**Replace with plain language:**
- Platform → tool, app, service
- Leverage → use
- Optimize → improve, make better

---

**5. Test memorability**

**Method:**
1. Tell someone your pitch once
2. Have them do a task for 5 minutes
3. Ask them to repeat your pitch

**Success:** They can recall the gist accurately

**Failure:** They can't remember or get it wrong

If failure → simplify further or make key words more distinctive.

## Framework 4: David Cowan - Pitchcraft

**Origin:** Bessemer Venture Partners' pitch methodology

**Structure:**
```
1. Problem highlight (what's broken?)
2. Solution offered (how you fix it)
3. One-sentence differentiation (why you, not others?)
4. Credibility boost (proof you can deliver)
```

**Why it works:**
- Problem-first approach (taps into pain)
- Solution naturally follows problem setup
- Differentiation prevents "why not competitor?" question
- Credibility overcomes skepticism
- Follows natural persuasion arc

---

### When to use:
- Problem is urgent/painful (high stakes)
- Market awareness of problem is high
- Multiple competitors exist (need differentiation)
- B2B sales contexts
- Regulated/trust-sensitive industries

---

### Examples:

**Good - Health Tech:**
1. Problem: "Melanoma kills 10,000 people/year. Early detection is critical but dermatologist wait times are 6+ weeks."
2. Solution: "We detect melanoma risk instantly using your smartphone camera."
3. Differentiation: "We're the only FDA-cleared AI using WHO-approved dermatology standards."
4. Credibility: "Validated in clinical trials with 95% accuracy across 50,000 scans."

**Good - B2B SaaS:**
1. Problem: "Support teams drown in repetitive tickets, burning out agents and delaying responses."
2. Solution: "We automate 60% of support tickets using AI."
3. Differentiation: "Unlike generic chatbots, we learn from YOUR past tickets specifically."
4. Credibility: "Trusted by Shopify, Mailchimp, and 500+ support teams."

**Bad:**
1. Problem: "Businesses need better software" → Vague
2. Solution: "We built a platform" → Unclear
3. Differentiation: "We're the best" → Not believable
4. Credibility: "We're passionate" → Not proof

---

### Step-by-step:

**1. Highlight Problem (Urgency + Stakes)**

**Formula:**
```
[Bad thing] happens because [current situation]. This causes [negative outcome].
```

**Bad examples:**
- "Marketing is hard" → Not specific
- "People waste time" → Not urgent

**Good examples:**
- "43% of e-commerce carts are abandoned at checkout. This costs retailers $18 billion annually."
- "70% of antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily, driving antibiotic resistance and endangering millions."

**How to find your problem:**
- Customer interviews: "What problem were you trying to solve?"
- Look for intense emotional language (frustrated, overwhelmed, terrified)
- Quantify the cost (time, money, health, reputation)

**Test:** Does your target customer nod in recognition?

---

**2. Offer Solution (How You Fix It)**

**Formula:**
```
We [action verb] [the problem] by [method/mechanism].
```

**Action verbs:**
- Eliminate, reduce, prevent (for problems)
- Increase, accelerate, improve (for opportunities)
- Automate, simplify, streamline (for complexity)

**Good examples:**
- "We reduce cart abandonment by 30% through one-click checkout."
- "We prevent unnecessary prescriptions using rapid diagnostic tests."

**Bad examples:**
- "We offer a comprehensive solution" → Vague
- "We help businesses succeed" → Generic

**Bridge test:** Does your solution DIRECTLY address the stated problem?

---

**3. One-Sentence Differentiation (Why You?)**

**Formula:**
```
Unlike [competitors/alternative], we [unique advantage].
```

or

```
We're the only [category] that [unique capability].
```

**Good examples:**
- "Unlike generic chatbots, we're trained on YOUR company's data specifically."
- "We're the only platform that integrates directly with all major EMR systems."
- "Unlike agencies that take weeks, we deliver designs in 48 hours."

**Bad examples:**
- "We're the best" → Opinion, not differentiation
- "We care more" → Intangible
- "We have more features" → Doesn't explain advantage

**Find your differentiation:**
- What can you do that competitors can't?
- What do customers praise you for vs. alternatives?
- What's your unfair advantage? (Network, data, technology, team)

---

**4. Credibility Boost (Proof You Deliver)**

**Types of credibility:**

**Social proof:**
- "Trusted by [impressive client list]"
- "Used by 10,000+ [customer type]"
- "Featured in [major publication]"

**Performance proof:**
- "95% customer satisfaction rate"
- "Processed $1B in transactions"
- "Achieved 99.99% uptime for 5 years"

**Authority proof:**
- "FDA-cleared"
- "SOC 2 Type II certified"
- "Backed by [notable investor]"

**Expert team proof:**
- "Founded by [impressive background]"
- "Team of ex-[Google/Amazon/etc] engineers"

**Choose proof most relevant to customer objections.**

**For trust-sensitive:** Certifications, compliance
**For results-skeptical:** Performance data, case studies
**For legitimacy-questioning:** Investors, press, client logos

---

**5. Combine into narrative**

**Structure options:**

**Short version (2-3 sentences):**
"[Problem]. We [solution] [differentiation]. [Credibility]."

**Medium version (4-5 sentences):**
"[Problem + stakes]. Traditional approaches [why they fail]. We [solution] using [mechanism]. Unlike [competitors], we [differentiation]. [Credibility proof]."

**Long version (full paragraph):**
Add customer story between problem and solution:
"[Problem]. [Company X] faced this when [specific situation]. We helped them [solution] resulting in [outcome]. Unlike [competitors] that [limitation], we [differentiation] because [reason]. Today, [credibility proof]."

## Combining Frameworks

**You can layer frameworks:**

**Example: XYZ Method + Pitchcraft**
1. Problem: "Remote teams struggle with async communication, leading to delays and misalignment."
2. Solution (XYZ): "We help remote teams stay aligned using async video standups."
3. Differentiation: "Unlike Zoom or Slack, we're specifically designed for async—no meeting scheduling required."
4. Credibility: "Used by 1,000+ remote-first companies including GitLab and Buffer."

**Example: High-Concept Pitch + Elevator Pitch**
- "Shopify, but for creators: A simple way to sell digital products online."

**Test multiple combinations, measure what converts.**

---

## Framework Selection Guide

| Use Case | Best Framework |
|----------|---------------|
| Complex B2B solution | Pitchcraft (problem → solution → proof) |
| Simple consumer app | Elevator Pitch (memorable, shareable) |
| New twist on known product | High-Concept Pitch (anchors to familiar) |
| Specific target customer | XYZ Method (defines who, what, how) |
| High-stakes problem (health, finance) | Pitchcraft (urgency + credibility) |
| Crowded market | XYZ + Pitchcraft (specificity + differentiation) |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping research**
   - Writing from assumptions, not customer interviews
   - Using marketing language instead of customer vocabulary

2. **Trying to include everything**
   - "We help everyone do everything using all the features"
   - Result: Vague and unmemorable

3. **Feature-listing instead of outcome-focus**
   - "We have 50 integrations and advanced analytics"
   - Customer thinks: "So what? What do I GET?"

4. **Jargon overload**
   - "Leveraging AI/ML to optimize workflows"
   - Customer thinks: "What does that actually MEAN?"

5. **Clever wordplay over clarity**
   - Puns, abstract metaphors, cryptic taglines
   - If they don't understand in 5 seconds, you lost them

6. **No differentiation**
   - "We help businesses grow using software"
   - Could describe 10,000 companies

7. **Unbelievable claims**
   - "10x your revenue in 10 days guaranteed!"
   - Triggers skepticism, not interest

---

## Testing Your UVP Statement

**Before deploying, validate:**

**Five-Second Test:**
- Show UVP for 5 seconds
- Hide it
- Ask: "What does this company do?"
- Success = 80%+ accuracy

**Competitor Confusion Test:**
- Remove your company name from UVP
- Ask: "Which company is this?"
- If they can't tell it's YOU, differentiation is weak

**Outcome Clarity Test:**
- Ask: "What would you get from using this?"
- If they list features instead of outcomes, rewrite

**Jargon Test:**
- Grandmother rule: Would she understand?
- If no, simplify language

**See:** TESTING.md for complete testing protocols

## Framework 5: April Dunford - 10-Step Positioning Process

**Origin:** April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome" - definitive B2B positioning methodology

**Structure:**
```
10 sequential steps that build positioning from ground up,
starting with actual customer understanding (not assumptions).
```

**Why it works:**
- Customer-first approach (starts with who LOVES you, not who you WANT)
- Eliminates positioning "baggage" from past decisions
- Maps unique attributes to actual customer value
- Creates defensible market position
- Works especially well for B2B and tech products

---

### When to use:
- Customers don't understand what you do
- Sales cycles are too long (confusion)
- Competitors positioned differently winning deals
- Product has evolved but positioning hasn't
- New to market or repositioning existing product

---

### The 10 Steps:

**Step 1: Understand customers who LOVE you**
- Not average customers - your BEST customers
- Who would be devastated if you disappeared?
- What do they do with your product that makes them successful?

**Questions:**
- Which customers renew fastest?
- Which expand their usage?
- Which refer others?
- Which require least support?

---

**Step 2: Assemble positioning team**
- Cross-functional: Sales, Marketing, Product, CS, Exec
- One session, 3-4 hours, no distractions
- Leave egos at door
- Someone to facilitate (can be external)

**Why team matters:**
- Sales knows objections
- CS knows real usage
- Product knows capabilities
- Marketing knows messaging that worked/failed

---

**Step 3: Clear positioning "baggage"**
- Start from zero - no assumptions
- Pretend you're seeing product for first time
- Question everything: "Why do we call it this?"
- Remove historical decisions that no longer serve

**Exercise:**
List current positioning assumptions. Challenge each:
- "We're a CRM" → Are we really? What would NEW customers call us?
- "We compete with X" → Do our best customers compare us to X?

---

**Step 4: List competitive alternatives**

**NOT direct competitors only.**

What would customers do if you didn't exist?
- Competitors
- Manual processes (Excel, email)
- In-house solutions
- Doing nothing

**Example for project management SaaS:**
- Asana, Monday (direct competitors)
- Spreadsheets (manual alternative)
- Email chains (doing nothing systematically)
- In-house tools (big companies)

---

**Step 5: Identify unique attributes**

What do you have that alternatives DON'T?

**Categories:**
- Features (what it does)
- Company (team expertise, location, funding)
- Product (architecture, integrations, speed)
- Process (methodology, support, implementation)

**Be honest:** If a competitor has it too, it's NOT unique.

**Example:**
- We have: AI-powered suggestions (competitors don't)
- We have: Specific integration with Shopify (competitors have generic)
- We have: Built by ex-Salesforce engineers (relevant expertise)

---

**Step 6: Map attributes to VALUE themes**

Attributes mean nothing until translated to customer value.

**Process:**
```
Unique Attribute → So What? → Value to Customer
```

**Example:**
- AI suggestions → responds faster → "Respond to tickets 10x faster"
- Shopify integration → sees order history → "Full context without tab switching"
- Ex-Salesforce team → understands enterprise needs → "Built for scale from day one"

**Group into themes:**
- Speed theme: AI suggestions + simplified UI = "Fastest response times"
- Context theme: Integrations + history = "Complete customer picture"

---

**Step 7: Determine WHO cares most**

Not everyone values your unique attributes equally.

**Questions:**
- Who has the problem your attributes solve?
- Who values speed most? Context most?
- Who is currently underserved by alternatives?

**Segmentation options:**
- Industry (restaurants, SaaS, e-commerce)
- Company size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- Role (support manager, founder, ops team)
- Behavior (high volume, complex workflows)

**Your BEST customers = who values your unique attributes most**

---

**Step 8: Find market frame of reference**

Which market category makes your strengths obvious?

**Three options:**

1. **Existing category:** Position in known market
   - Easier to understand
   - But compared to existing leader
   - Example: "CRM for restaurants"

2. **Subcategory:** Create segment of existing market
   - Best of both worlds
   - Leverages category understanding + differentiation
   - Example: "Conversational CRM" (Drift)

3. **New category:** Create entirely new market
   - High risk, high reward
   - Requires significant market education
   - Only if truly groundbreaking
   - Example: "Revenue Intelligence" (Gong)

**Choose frame that makes your UNIQUE attributes shine.**

---

**Step 9: Layer trends (optional)**

If relevant trend supports your positioning, add it.

**Good trend layering:**
- "AI-powered support" → ties to AI trend
- "Remote-first collaboration" → ties to remote work trend

**Bad trend layering:**
- Forcing irrelevant trends for buzzwords
- Trend already fading

**Questions:**
- Does trend make our differentiation stronger?
- Are target customers aware of and positive about this trend?
- Is trend sustainable (not fad)?

---

**Step 10: Document and share**

Create positioning document everyone can use.

**Positioning statement template:**
```
For [target customer]
who [key need/problem],
[product name] is a [market category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [competitive alternatives],
we [key differentiator].
```

**Include:**
- Competitive alternatives (what we're NOT)
- Unique attributes (what we HAVE)
- Value themes (what customers GET)
- Best-fit customers (who this is FOR)
- Market category (what we ARE)

---

### Full Example:

**Drift's positioning (from book):**

1. **Best customers:** B2B SaaS marketing teams
2. **Alternatives:** Forms, email, phone, live chat
3. **Unique attributes:** Conversational, bot + human, sales qualification built-in
4. **Value:** Convert visitors to meetings instantly (not hours/days later)
5. **Who cares:** Companies with high-value leads losing deals to slow response
6. **Market frame:** Created "Conversational Marketing" category
7. **Trend:** Messaging apps (Slack, etc.) changing communication expectations

**Result:** Market leader in new category they defined.

---

### Common Mistakes:

**Starting with positioning statement:**
- Write statement LAST, after completing 10 steps
- Statement should capture insights, not generate them

**Using internal assumptions:**
- "We think customers want..." is wrong approach
- Interview actual best customers

**Too many unique attributes:**
- Focus on 3-5 that matter MOST to best customers
- More dilutes the message

**Wrong market frame:**
- Choosing category that highlights weaknesses vs. alternatives
- Example: Don't position as "enterprise CRM" if you lack enterprise features
