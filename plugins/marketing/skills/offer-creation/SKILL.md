description: Creates compelling, high-value offers using Grand Slam Offer, Value Equation, and M-A-G-I-C Headline frameworks from Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers. Use when creating a new product/service offer, designing pricing and value stacking, making an offer stand out from competition, naming offers and headlines, or when conversion rate is low. Trigger phrases include "irresistible offer", "value stacking", "offer naming", "my offer doesn't convert". NOT for positioning strategy (use uvp-optimization), growth experiments (use growth-hacking), or onboarding optimization (use product-led-growth).

# Offer Creation

## Overview

This skill helps create compelling, high-value offers using frameworks from Alex Hormozi's "$100M Offers". Use when you need to create or improve offers that customers can't refuse.

**Announce:** "I'm using offer-creation to build an irresistible offer using Hormozi's frameworks."

## When to Use

**USE this skill:**

- Creating new product/service offer
- Pricing strategy and value stacking
- Making offer stand out from competition
- Naming offers and headlines
- "How do I make my offer irresistible?"
- "My conversion rate is low"

**DON'T use this skill:**

- Positioning (who is it for?) → `uvp-optimization`
- Growth experiments → `growth-hacking`
- Onboarding optimization → `product-led-growth`

## Iron Law

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort)

To increase value without lowering price:
- INCREASE Dream Outcome (what they get)
- INCREASE Perceived Likelihood (belief it will work)
- DECREASE Time Delay (faster results)
- DECREASE Effort & Sacrifice (easier for them)
```

## Core Frameworks

### Framework 1: Grand Slam Offer

**Purpose:** Create an offer so good people feel stupid saying no.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Dream Outcome**
   - What does your ideal customer want to achieve?
   - Think end result, not features
   - Be specific and emotional

2. **List All Problems**
   - What problems do they face BEFORE using your product?
   - What problems might arise DURING use?
   - What problems remain AFTER initial result?
   - List 10-20 problems minimum

3. **Transform Problems into Solutions**
   - Each problem becomes a "How to..." solution
   - Name each solution attractively
   - Focus on outcomes, not processes

4. **Determine Delivery Vehicles**
   | Delivery Type | Examples | Scalability |
   |---------------|----------|-------------|
   | 1-on-1 | Coaching, consulting | Low |
   | Small group | Workshops, masterminds | Medium |
   | 1-to-many | Courses, community | High |
   | DIY | Templates, tools, software | Highest |
   | DFY (Done for you) | Full service | Premium price |

5. **Trim & Stack**
   - Keep only HIGH VALUE + LOW COST items
   - Remove low value items (even if easy)
   - Stack remaining into irresistible bundle

**Output:** Offer that combines multiple high-value solutions impossible to compare with competitors.

---

### Framework 2: Value Equation

**Purpose:** Increase perceived value without changing price.

**The Equation:**

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort)
```

**Optimization Strategies:**

| Variable                 | How to Optimize                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dream Outcome**        | Paint vivid picture of end state, use specific numbers, show transformations |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | Case studies, testimonials, guarantees, credentials, demonstrations          |
| **Time Delay**           | Quick wins, fast onboarding, immediate value, show progress                  |
| **Effort & Sacrifice**   | Done-for-you options, templates, automation, remove friction                 |

**Application Checklist:**

- [ ] Is dream outcome crystal clear and desirable?
- [ ] Do customers believe they can achieve it with you?
- [ ] How fast do they see first results?
- [ ] How much effort is required from them?

### Framework 3: M-A-G-I-C Headline Formula

**Purpose:** Name your offer to maximize appeal in ads and marketing.

**Formula:**

| Letter | Element   | Purpose           | Example                              |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **M**  | Magnet    | Attention grabber | "FREE", "88% off", "New"             |
| **A**  | Avatar    | Who is this for   | "For SaaS founders", "For busy moms" |
| **G**  | Goal      | Dream outcome     | "Get 100 customers", "Lose 10kg"     |
| **I**  | Interval  | Time frame        | "in 30 days", "this weekend"         |
| **C**  | Container | Wrapper/format    | "Blueprint", "Challenge", "System"   |

**Examples:**

- "FREE Blueprint for SaaS Founders to Get First 100 Customers in 90 Days"
- "The 7-Day Challenge for Busy Moms to Meal Prep Like a Pro"
- "88% OFF: Restaurant Owner's System to Double Revenue This Quarter"

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand Current State

**Questions to ask:**

1. What do you currently offer?
2. What price are you charging?
3. How does competition price similar offerings?
4. What's your conversion rate?
5. What objections do customers have?

### Phase 2: Apply Value Equation

Rate current offer 1-10 on each dimension:

- Dream Outcome clarity: \_\_\_/10
- Perceived Likelihood: \_\_\_/10
- Time Delay (inverse): \_\_\_/10
- Effort Required (inverse): \_\_\_/10

Focus improvement on LOWEST scores first.

### Phase 3: Build Grand Slam Offer

1. List 20 problems customer faces
2. Create solution for each
3. Choose delivery vehicles
4. Trim to high-value, low-cost
5. Stack into bundle

### Phase 4: Name with M-A-G-I-C

Create 3-5 headline variations using formula.
Test which resonates most.

### Phase 5: Price with Confidence

**Pricing principle:** Price should feel like a "steal" compared to value delivered.

Calculate value stack:

```
Solution 1: Worth $X
Solution 2: Worth $Y
Solution 3: Worth $Z
Bonus 1: Worth $A
Bonus 2: Worth $B
---
Total Value: $XXXXX
Your Price: $YYY (fraction of value)
```

## Quick Router

| Situation                            | Framework to Use                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "My offer is similar to competitors" | Grand Slam Offer (differentiate through bundling) |
| "Customers don't see the value"      | Value Equation (improve perceived likelihood)     |
| "My headline doesn't convert"        | M-A-G-I-C Formula                                 |
| "I don't know what to include"       | Grand Slam Offer (problem→solution mapping)       |
| "Customers say it's too expensive"   | Value Equation (increase top, decrease bottom)    |

## Red Flags

**STOP and reconsider if:**

- No clear dream outcome → Can't create compelling offer
- Only competing on price → Commodity trap
- Too many features, no transformation → Feature bloat
- Customers confused about what they get → Simplify

## Common Mistakes

**Listing features instead of outcomes:**
"24/7 support" → "Never feel stuck again - instant help anytime"

**Vague dream outcomes:**
"Improve your business" → "Add $50K MRR in 90 days"

**Ignoring effort reduction:**
Offering more doesn't help if it creates more work for customer.

**No risk reversal:**
Without guarantee, perceived likelihood drops.

## Integration

After offer created, route to:

- `web-copy` → Sales page implementation
- `newsletter` → Email sequence for offer
- `pricing` → Advanced pricing tactics

Before offer creation, ensure:

- `uvp-optimization` → Positioning is clear
- `growth-hacking` → PMF validated (don't polish bad offer)
